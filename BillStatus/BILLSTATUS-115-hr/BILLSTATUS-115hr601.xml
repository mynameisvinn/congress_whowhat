Requires the President to provide an opportunity for public comment on the strategy.</p> <p>Requires such strategy to seek to: (1) prioritize assistance to U.S. partner countries whose populations are most in need of improved basic education; (2) build the capacity of relevant actors in partner countries to develop national education plans that improve basic education; (3) identify and replicate successful interventions that improve access to and quality of basic education in conflict settings and in partner countries; (4) develop means to track implementation in partner countries and ensure that such countries are expending appropriate domestic resources and instituting relevant legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms; (5) leverage U.S. capabilities, including through technical assistance, training, and research; and (6) improve coordination and reduce duplication among relevant agencies, donors, multilateral and nongovernmental organizations, and partner country governments. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) Establishes within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) the position of Senior Coordinator of United States International Basic Education Assistance, who shall have primary responsibility for the oversight and coordination of U.S. government resources and activities relating to the promotion of international basic education. Requires the President to eliminate a USAID position in order to offset costs and eliminate duplication of activities involved in appointing such senior coordinator. </p> <p>(Sec. 6) Requires the President to ensure that programs carried out under the comprehensive strategy: (1) apply monitoring and evaluation methodologies to determine if programs and activities accomplish measurable improvements in literacy or other basic skills development; (2) include funding for both short- and long-term monitoring and evaluation; and (3) disaggregate as appropriate all data collected by age, gender, marital status, disability, and location. </p> <p>(Sec. 7) Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual implementation report. </p> <p>DIVISION B--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS ACT, 2017 </p> <p><em>Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 </em></p> <p>Provides $15.25 billion in FY2017 supplemental appropriations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for disaster relief requirements, such as response and recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. </p> <p>Specifies that the $15.25 billion includes: </p> <ul> <li> $7.4 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, </li> <li> $450 million for the SBA's Disaster Loans Program Account, and </li> <li> $7.4 billion for HUD's Community Development Block Grant program. </li> </ul> <p>Designates the funds as an emergency requirement and provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the funds and transmits the designation to Congress.
