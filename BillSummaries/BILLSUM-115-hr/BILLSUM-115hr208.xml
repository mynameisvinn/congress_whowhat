<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Ensuring Health Care Opportunities Act</b></p> <p>This bill waives certain health insurance benefit requirements in states with a county where only one health insurer offers individual coverage. In these states, health plans are not required to provide essential health benefits to be offered in the individual or small group market or through the health insurance exchange. (Plans offered in the individual market or through an exchange fulfill the requirement for individuals to maintain minimum essential coverage.)</p>]]></summary-text>
