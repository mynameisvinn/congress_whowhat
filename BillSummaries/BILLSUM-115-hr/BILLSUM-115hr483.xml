<summary-text><![CDATA[<p> <b>No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends title IV (Student Aid) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make an institution of higher education (IHE) that is a sanctuary campus ineligible for funds under title IV. </p> <p>It defines the term &quot;sanctuary campus.&quot; </p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security must transmit to the Department of Education and publish in the Federal Register notice of a determination that an IHE is a sanctuary campus. </p> <p>The bill expresses the sense of Congress that providing in-state tuition to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status in the United States creates an incentive for illegal immigration and encourages and induces aliens to come to, enter, or reside in the United States. </p>]]></summary-text>
