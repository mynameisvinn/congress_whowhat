<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>San Juan County Settlement Implementation Act</b></p> This bill provides that if the Department of the Interior retires a coal preference right lease application under the Mineral Leasing Act by issuing a bidding right in exchange for the relinquishment of such application, such bidding right may subsequently be used in lieu of 50% of the amount owed for any monetary payment of: (1) a bonus in a coal lease sale; or (2) rental or royalty under a federal coal lease. <p>Interior shall calculate a payment of the amounts owed to a relevant state pursuant to such Act based on the combined value of the bidding rights and the amounts received. </p> <p>Interior shall make such payments to a relevant state from monetary payments received by Interior when bidding rights are exercised pursuant to this bill. </p> <p>A bidding right issued for a coal preference right lease application under such Act shall be fully transferable to any other person. Such bidding right shall terminate seven years after it is issued.</p> <p>The bill cancels specified land selections made by the Navajo Nation pursuant to the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 and authorizes such nation to make land selections equal in value to those canceled, subject to an acreage cap, specified land exclusions, and a seven-year deadline. </p>]]></summary-text>
