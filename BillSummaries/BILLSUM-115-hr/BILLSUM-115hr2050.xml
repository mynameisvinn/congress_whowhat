<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Medicare Demonstration of Coverage for Low Vision Devices Act of 2017</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to&nbsp;carry out&nbsp;a demonstration project to evaluate the fiscal impact of covering low-vision devices under Medicare in the same manner as Medicare coverage is provided for durable medical equipment. "Low-vision device" means a physician-prescribed device that magnifies, enhances, or otherwise augments or interprets visual images; the term does not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p> <p> The bill appropriates $2.5 million&nbsp;for FY2018 and each of the next four fiscal&nbsp;years for the CMS to carry out the project.</p>]]></summary-text>
