<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b><b>Lower Drug Costs through Competition Act</b></b></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise provisions regarding review and approval of generic drug applications or supplements to generic drug applications for drugs: (1) for which there is a shortage, or (2) that have not been recently introduced to the market by more than one manufacturer and for which tentative approval has not been granted to more than two applications.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must prioritize the review of such submissions and act on them within 180 days. The FDA may expedite the inspection of a facility proposed to manufacture such a drug.</p> <p>Beginning FY2019, the FDA must award a transferrable generic drug priority review voucher to the sponsor of such an application once the drug has a sustained market presence. A voucher may be used to have the FDA review and take action upon a generic drug application within 180 days of submission. The FDA must establish an additional user fee for applications subject to a voucher. This voucher program is terminated at the start of FY2024.</p> <p>The FDA must periodically report on generic drug applications filed before FY2018 that are still pending.</p> <p>For a new drug application to be eligible for a priority review voucher as a tropical disease product application, the application must include new, essential clinical investigations.</p> The Government Accountability Office must study the FDA's program for drug risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.]]></summary-text>
