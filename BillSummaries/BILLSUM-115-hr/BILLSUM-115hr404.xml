<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act of 2017</strong></p> <p> This bill prohibits a federal agency from deploying or making available to the public a new federal personally identifiable information website (new Federal PII Website) until the chief information officer of the agency submits a certification to Congress that the website is fully functional and secure. "New Federal PII website" is defined as a website that: (1) is operated by (or under contract with) an agency; (2) elicits, collects, stores, or maintains personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to identify an individual, such as a social security number, a date and place of birth, a mother's maiden name, biometric records, or other information linked to an individual); and (3) is first made accessible to the public and collects or stores personally identifiable information on or after October 1, 2012.</p> <p>Beta websites designed for testing and development are exempted if users execute an agreement acknowledging the risks involved.</p> <p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must establish and oversee policies and procedures for federal agencies to follow in the event of a breach of information security involving the disclosure of personally identifiable information, including: (1) notice, by 72 hours after discovery of a breach or possible breach, to individuals whose personally identifiable information could be compromised as a result of such breach; (2) timely reporting to a federal cybersecurity center designated by this bill; and (3) any additional actions that the OMB finds necessary and appropriate. </p> <p>The bill requires: (1) agency heads to ensure that agency actions taken in response to a breach comply with OMB policies and procedures established by this bill; and (2) the OMB to report to Congress, by March 1 of each year, on agency compliance with such policies and procedures. </p>]]></summary-text>
