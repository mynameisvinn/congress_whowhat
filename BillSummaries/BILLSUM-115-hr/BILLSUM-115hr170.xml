<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Protect and Grow American Jobs Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise the definition of &quot;exempt H-1B nonimmigrant&quot; to eliminate the masters or higher degree requirement and raise the annual salary threshold requirement from $60,000 to $100,000. </p> <p>(An exempt H-1B nonimmigrant is a nonimmigrant H-1B [specialty occupation] worker meeting certain criteria whom an H-1B dependent employer may hire without having to satisfy certain otherwise applicable H-1B hiring criteria. An H-1B dependent employer is generally one whose H-1B workers comprise 15% or more of the employer's total workforce, with different thresholds applying to smaller employers.)</p> <p>The bill requires an inflation adjustment to the salary threshold every third fiscal year.</p>]]></summary-text>
