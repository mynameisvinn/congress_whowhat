<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>End The Shutdown Act of 2018 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to extend the expiration date of the FY2018 Continuing Resolution (CR) from January 19, 2018, to January 26, 2018. </p> <p>The bill provides continuing appropriations for federal agencies through the earlier of January 26, 2018, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation. It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing CR expired because none of the 12 FY2018 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted. </p> <p>The bill also provides funding flexibility or additional funding for specified accounts within the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. </p>]]></summary-text>
