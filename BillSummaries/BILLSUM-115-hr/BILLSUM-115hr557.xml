<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>FCC &quot;ABCs&quot; Act of</b> <b>2017</b></p> <p>This bill amends Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the case of a proposed or final rule (including a proposed or final amendment to an existing rule) that may have an economically significant impact, to include in the notice a cost-benefit analysis demonstrating that the benefits outweigh the costs, recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult to quantify.</p> <p>An &quot;economically significant impact&quot; is defined as an effect on the economy of at least $100 million annually or a material adverse effect on the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities.</p> <p>The bill prohibits any appropriations for the express purpose of carrying out such analysis and notice requirements. </p> <p>The FCC must presume, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, that: (1) forbearance requirements are met when determining whether to forbear from applying any regulation or provision under such Act to a telecommunications carrier, service, or class; and (2) regulations considered in each biennial regulatory review are no longer necessary in the public interest as the result of meaningful economic competition between providers of telecommunications service.</p>]]></summary-text>
