<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since the House agreed to the Senate amendment without amendment on December 20, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)</p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>(Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.) </p> <p>TITLE I</p> <p>Subtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform </p> <p>Part I--Tax Rate Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket. </p> <p>The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household. </p> <p>(Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation. </p> <p>Part II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities </p> <p>(Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income. </p> <p>The bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives. </p> <p>The deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction. </p> <p>The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns). </p> <p>A &quot;specified service trade or business&quot; is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services. </p> <p>(Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses. </p> <p>An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018. </p> <p>In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner's distributive share and each S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in applying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corporation shareholder. </p> <p>Losses prohibited under this section are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years. </p> <p>Part III--Tax Benefits For Families And Individuals </p> <p>(Sec. 11021) This section temporarily increases the standard deduction to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,000 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI. </p> <p>(Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child. In order to receive the credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non-refundable credit is claimed. </p> <p>(Sec. 11023) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitation for contributions of cash to public charities.</p> <p>(Sec. 11024) This section temporarily increases contribution limitations for ABLE accounts with respect to contributions made by the designated beneficiary of the account. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.) </p> <p>After the limit is reached, the designated beneficiary may contribute an additional amount up to the lesser of: (1) the federal poverty line for a one-person household, or (2) the individual's compensation for the taxable year. </p> <p>The bill also allows the designated beneficiary of an ABLE account to claim the saver's credit for contributions made to his or her account. </p> <p>(Sec. 11025) This section allows funds from qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans) to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of the 529 account or a member of the designated beneficiary's family. </p> <p>(Sec. 11026) This section temporarily allows certain members of the Armed Forces in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to receive combat zone tax benefits for performing services that qualify for special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger. </p> <p>(Sec. 11027) For 2017 and 2018, this section reduces from 10% to 7.5% the AGI threshold that must be exceeded before a taxpayer is allowed to claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 11028) This section provides tax incentives for areas in which a major disaster was declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during calendar year 2016. </p> <p>For individuals residing in the 2016 disaster areas, the bill allows: (1) exceptions to the 10% penalty for up to $100,000 in early withdrawals from retirement plans, and (2) personal casualty losses exceeding $500 per casualty to be deducted without regard to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10% of a taxpayer's AGI. </p> <p>Part IV--Education </p> <p>(Sec. 11031) This section temporarily modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income to exclude from gross income certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student. </p> <p>(Sec. 11032) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be used for expenses for tuition in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school. </p> <p>Part V--Deductions And Exclusions </p> <p>(Sec. 11041) This section: (1) suspends the deduction for personal exemptions, (2) modifies the wage withholding rules, (3) and modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return. </p> <p>(Sec. 11042) This section temporarily limits individual deductions for certain state and local taxes to $10,000 per year ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The limit does not apply to taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income. </p> <p>(Sec. 11043) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) temporarily limit the deduction for debt incurred on or before December 15, 2017, to mortgages of up to $750,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) suspend the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans. </p> <p>For taxable years beginning after 2025, the deduction applies to mortgages of up to $1 million regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred. </p> <p>(Sec. 11044) This section temporarily modifies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. A taxpayer may only claim the deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. The bill includes an exception for certain personal casualty losses that do not exceed personal casualty gains. </p> <p>(Sec. 11045) This section suspends all miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the 2% floor under present law. </p> <p>(Sec. 11046) This section suspends the overall limitation on itemized deductions, which currently applies when AGI exceeds a specified amount.</p> <p>(Sec. 11047) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements. </p> <p>(Sec. 11048) This section suspends the exclusion for qualified moving expense reimbursements, with an exception for members of the Armed Forces on active duty who move pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station.</p> <p>(Sec. 11049) This section suspends the deduction for moving expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 11050) This section temporarily modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions. The bill specifies that &quot;losses from wagering transactions&quot; include otherwise deductible expenses incurred in carrying out a wagering transaction (e.g., expenses for traveling to or from a casino). </p> <p>(Sec. 11051) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payor spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse. </p> <p>Part VI--Increase In Estate And Gift Tax Exemption </p> <p>(Sec. 11061) This section doubles the estate and gift tax exemption amount for decedents dying or gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, by increasing the basic exclusion amount from $5 million to $10 million. (Under current law, the amount is indexed for inflation occurring after 2011.) </p> <p>Part VII--Extension Of Time Limit For Contesting IRS Levy </p> <p>(Sec. 11071) This section extends from nine months to two years the time limit for contesting an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy, including the time periods for: (1) returning the monetary proceeds from the sale of property that has been wrongfully levied upon, and (2) bringing a civil action for a wrongful levy. </p> <p>Part VIII--Individual Mandate </p> <p>(Sec. 11081) This section repeals the penalty for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential health coverage as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the individual mandate). </p> <p>Subtitle B--Alternative Minimum Tax </p> <p>(Sec. 12001) This section repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). </p> <p>(Sec. 12002) This section modifies the AMT credit for corporations to: (1) allow the AMT credit to offset regular tax liability for any taxable year, and (2) make the credit refundable for any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in an amount equal to 50% (100% beginning in 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. </p> <p>(Under current law a corporation subject to the AMT in any year is allowed an AMT credit in any subsequent taxable year to the extent that the taxpayer's regular tax liability exceeds its tentative minimum tax in the subsequent year.) </p> <p>(Sec. 12003) This section temporarily increases both the exemption amount and the exemption amount phaseout thresholds for the individual AMT. The exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married taxpayers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The phaseout thresholds are increased to $1 million for married taxpayers filing a joint return, and $500,000 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The amounts are indexed for inflation after 2018.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Business-related Provisions </p> <p>Part I--Corporate Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 13001) This section reduces the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% under the existing graduated rate structure to a flat 21% rate for tax years beginning after 2017.

It also modifies the alternative depreciation system (ADS) recovery period for such property. </p> <p>(Under current law, &quot;qualified improvement property&quot; is any improvement to an interior portion of a building which is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service. It does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to: the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural framework of the building.) </p> <p>A real property trade or business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest must use the ADS to depreciate nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property. </p> <p>(Sec. 13205) This section requires a farming business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for interest to use the ADS to depreciate any property with a recovery period of 10 years or more. </p> <p>(Sec. 13206) This section adjusts the amortization rules and schedules for certain research and experimentation expenditures. </p> <p>(Sec. 13207) This section allows expensing of certain costs of replanting lost or damaged citrus plants lost by reason of casualty. </p> <p>Subpart B--Accounting Methods </p> <p>(Sec. 13221) This section revises the rules associated with the timing of the recognition of income. </p> <p>Part IV--Business-Related Exclusions And Deductions </p> <p>(Sec. 13301) This section limits the deduction for business interest to the sum of: (1) business interest income for the year, (2) 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (3) the floor plan financing interest of the taxpayer for the taxable year. </p> <p>The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any year may be carried forward indefinitely, with the exception of partnerships which are subject to additional carryforward rules specified in the bill. </p> <p>&quot;Business interest income&quot; is the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is properly allocable to a trade or business. It does not include investment income. </p> <p>&quot;Floor plan financing interest&quot; is interest paid on debt used to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease and secured by the inventory so acquired. </p> <p>The bill includes exceptions for: </p> <ul> <li> small businesses that meet the gross receipts test, </li> <li> the trade or business of performing services as an employee, </li> <li> any electing farming business, </li> <li> any electing real property trade or business, and </li> <li> certain regulated public utilities. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 13302) This section modifies the net operating loss deduction to: (1) limit the deduction to 80% of taxable income with an exception for property and casualty insurance companies, (2) repeal the two-year and other specified carryback provisions, (3) allow an indefinite carryforward of net operating losses, and (4) allow a two-year carryback for certain losses incurred in the trade or business of farming. </p> <p>(Sec. 13303) This section modifies the rule providing for the nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges to limit the application of the rule to real property that is not held primarily for sale. </p> <p>(Sec. 13304) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain expenses for entertainment and fringe benefits. </p> <p>The bill denies deductions for amounts paid or incurred for: </p> <ul> <li> an activity generally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation; </li> <li> membership dues for any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes; </li> <li> a facility or portion thereof used in connection with any of the above items; </li> <li> providing any qualified transportation fringe to employees of the taxpayer; or </li> <li> providing transportation for commuting between the employee's residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee. </li> </ul> <p>Under current law, taxpayers may deduct 50% of the food and beverage expenses associated with operating their trade or business, subject to certain exceptions. The bill temporarily expands the 50% limitation to include expenses of an employer associated with providing food and beverages through an eating facility that meets the requirements for a de minimis fringe. </p> <p>(Sec. 13305) This section repeals the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13306) This section prohibits deductions for trade or business expenses for any amount paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a government or governmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law. </p> <p>The bill includes exceptions for amounts constituting restitution or paid to come into compliance with law, amounts paid or incurred as a result of certain court orders, and taxes due. </p> <p>The bill also establishes reporting requirements for government entities with respect to certain fines, penalties, and other amounts. </p> <p>(Sec. 13307) This section prohibits a tax deduction for trade or business expenses paid or incurred for: (1) any settlement or payment related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse if such settlement or payment is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or (2) attorney's fees related to such a settlement or payment. </p> <p>(Sec. 13308) This section eliminates the deduction for lobbying expenditures to influence the legislation of any local council or similar governing body, including an Indian tribal government. </p> <p>(Sec. 13309) This section requires a three-year holding period (one year under current law) for certain net long-term capital gains with respect to partnership interests held in connection with the performance of investment services. If the holder of an applicable partnership interest is allocated gain from the sale of property held for less than three years, that gain is treated as short-term capital gain and is taxed as ordinary income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13310) This section prohibits cash, gift cards, and other non-tangible personal property from being considered tax deductible employee achievement awards. </p> <p>(Under current law, tangible personal property may be considered a deductible employee achievement award if other specified requirements are met.)</p> <p>The bill specifies that &quot;tangible personal property&quot; does not include: (1) cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons, or gift certificates (other than arrangements conferring only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited array of such items pre-selected or pre-approved by the employer); or (2) vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items. </p> <p>(Sec. 13311) This section eliminates the deduction for living expenses incurred by Members of Congress.

For the five-year period beginning in the year in which a qualified rehabilitated building is placed in service, the credit is equal to the ratable share for each year, which is 20% of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to the building, as allocated ratably to each year during the period. </p> <p>(Sec. 13403) This section allows employers to claim a general business credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to employees during any period in which such employees are on family and medical leave if the rate of payment under the program is 50% of the wages normally paid to an employee. </p> <p>The credit is increased by 0.25% (but not above 25%) for each percentage point by which the rate of payment exceeds 50%.

The bill specifies that &quot;a substantial built-in loss&quot; also exists if the transferee partner would be allocated a loss of more than $250,000 if the partnership assets were sold for cash equal to their fair market value immediately after such transfer. </p> <p>(Sec. 13503) This section modifies the basis limitation on a partner's distributive share of a partnership loss to require a partner's distributive share of partnership charitable contribution and taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and U.S. possessions to be taken into account in determining the limitation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13504) This section repeals the rule that provides for a technical termination of partnerships if, within any 12-month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits. </p> <p>Subpart B--Insurance Reforms </p> <p>(Sec. 13511) This section repeals the operations loss deduction for life insurance companies and allows the net operating loss deduction under section 172 of the IRC. </p> <p>(Sec. 13512) This section repeals the small life insurance company deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 13513) This section revises the tax treatment of income or loss resulting from a change in the method of computing life insurance company reserves. The bill eliminates the 10-year period for taking into account the changes and requires the changes to be taken into account as adjustments attributable to a change in the method of accounting. </p> <p>(Sec. 13514) This section repeals the special rule for distributions to shareholders of a stock life insurance company from a pre-1984 policyholders surplus account, which provides that amounts in the account are not taxed unless the amounts are treated as distributed to shareholders or subtracted from the account. The bill requires a life insurance company with such an account to pay taxes on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 13515) This section modifies the proration rules for property and casualty insurance companies to replace the 15% reduction with a reduction equal to 5.25% divided by the highest corporate tax rate in effect. (Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.) </p> <p>(Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.) </p> <p>(Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies. </p> <p>(Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company. </p> <p>(Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule, the company's share is 70% and the policyholder's share is 30%. </p> <p>(Sec. 13519) This section modifies the requirements for the capitalization of policy acquisition expenses of insurance companies to extend the amortization period from 120 months to 180 months. </p> <p>Under current law, policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company's general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specified percentage of the net premiums for the year on each of three categories of insurance contracts. </p> <p>The bill increases these percentages from 1.75% to 2.09% for annuity contracts, from 2.05% to 2.45% for group life insurance contracts, and from 7.7% to 9.2% for all other specified insurance contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 13520) This section establishes reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts in a reportable policy sale. It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits. </p> <p>A &quot;reportable policy sale&quot; is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract. </p> <p>(Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. The bill specifies that no basis adjustment shall be made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract. </p> <p>(Sec. 13522) This section exempts the transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale from the transfer for valuable consideration rule. </p> <p>(Under current law, the transfer for valuable consideration rule provides that, if a life insurance contract or an interest in a contract is transferred for a valuable consideration, the tax exclusion for amounts received under a life insurance contract due to the death of the insured is limited to the sum of the actual value of the consideration and the premiums and other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee.) </p> <p>(Sec. 13523) This section modifies the reserve discounting rules applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to: (1) modify the interest rate used to discount unpaid losses, (2) modify the computational rules for loss payment pattern, and (3) repeal the election to use a taxpayer's historical loss payment pattern. </p> <p>Subpart C--Banks and Financial Instruments </p> <p>(Sec. 13531) This section limits the deduction for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums for certain financial institutions with consolidated assets that exceed $10 billion. </p> <p>(Sec. 13532) This section repeals the exclusion from gross income for interest on a bond issued to advance refund another bond. </p> <p>Subpart D--S Corporations </p> <p>(Sec. 13541) This section allows a nonresident alien individual to be a qualifying beneficiary of an electing small business trust (ESBT), which is a type of trust that is permitted to hold shares in an S corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13542) This section specifies that the charitable contribution deduction of an ESBT is determined by the rules applicable to individuals rather than the rules applicable to trusts, except that the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust shall be treated as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13543) This section modifies the tax treatment of S corporation conversions to C corporations. </p> <p>Part VII--Employment </p> <p>Subpart A--Compensation </p> <p>(Sec. 13601) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for compensation of covered employees of a publicly held corporation to salaries of no more than $1 million per year. The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of &quot;covered employee,&quot; and (3) expands the definition of &quot;publicly held corporation.&quot; </p> <p>The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. </p> <p>(Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>(Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation. </p> <p>Subpart B--Retirement Plans </p> <p>(Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. </p> <p>(Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan. </p> <p>(Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.) </p> <p>The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017. </p> <p>In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A &quot;qualified plan loan offset amount&quot; is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant. </p> <p>Part VIII--Exempt Organizations </p> <p>(Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility. </p> <p>(Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights. </p> <p>(Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization. </p> <p>Part IX--Other Provisions </p> <p>Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer. </p> <p>For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met. </p> <p>(Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to: </p> <ul> <li> make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation; </li> <li>establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine; </li> <li> establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and </li> <li> make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit. </li> </ul> <p>The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon. </p> <p>(Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for &quot;mead&quot; and &quot;low alcohol by volume wine&quot; that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine. </p> <p>(Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter. </p> <p>Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates. </p> <p>(Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax. This provision applies to distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020. </p> <p>Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 13821) This section modifies the tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to: (1) allow an Alaska Native Corporation to assign certain payments referenced in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to a trust without including the payments in the gross income of the corporation, (2) allow the corporation to elect annually to deduct contributions made to a trust, (3) allow a trust to elect to defer the recognition of gains related to contributions of property other than cash until the sale or exchange of the property, and (4) establish information reporting requirements for deductible contributions to a trust. </p> <p>(Sec. 13822) This section exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. </p> <p>(Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held. </p> <p>Subtitle D--International Tax Provisions </p> <p>Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> <p>Part I--Outbound Transactions </p> <p>Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section. </p> <p>The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception. </p> <p>(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. </p> <p>For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation. </p> <p>The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes. </p> <p>The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings. </p> <p>The tax may be paid in installments over eight years. </p> <p>The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts. </p> <p>Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income </p> <p>Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill. </p> <p>Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments </p> <p>(Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual. </p> <p>The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property. </p> <p>The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. </p> <p>A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill </p> <p>(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends. </p> <p>Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion. </p> <p>(Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries. </p> <p>(Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source. </p> <p>A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss. </p> <p>Part II--Inbound Transactions </p> <p>(Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax. </p> <p>An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers). </p> <p>Part III--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income. </p> <p>TITLE II </p> <p>(Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain.</p> <p>Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program. </p> <p>(Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.</p> <p> (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury. </p> <p>DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. </p>]]></summary-text>

<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>(Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.) </p> <p>TITLE I</p> <p><i></i>Subtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform </p> <p>Part I--Tax Rate Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket. </p> <p>The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household. </p> <p>(Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation. </p> <p>Part II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities </p> <p>(Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income. </p> <p>The bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives. </p> <p>The deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction. </p> <p>The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns). </p> <p>A &quot;specified service trade or business&quot; is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services. </p> <p>(Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses. </p> <p>An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018. </p> <p>In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner's distributive share and each S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in applying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corporation shareholder. </p> <p>Losses prohibited under this section are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years. </p> <p>Part III--Tax Benefits For Families And Individuals </p> <p>(Sec. 11021) This section temporarily increases the standard deduction to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,000 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI. </p> <p>(Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child.

The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>(Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation. </p> <p>Subpart B--Retirement Plans </p> <p>(Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. </p> <p>(Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan. </p> <p>(Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.) </p> <p>The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017. </p> <p>In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A &quot;qualified plan loan offset amount&quot; is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant. </p> <p>Part VIII--Exempt Organizations </p> <p>(Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility. </p> <p>(Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights. </p> <p>(Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization. </p> <p>Part IX--Other Provisions </p> <p>Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer. </p> <p>For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met. </p> <p>(Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to: </p> <ul> <li> make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation; </li> <li>establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine; </li> <li> establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and </li> <li> make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit. </li> </ul> <p>The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon. </p> <p>(Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for &quot;mead&quot; and &quot;low alcohol by volume wine&quot; that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine. </p> <p>(Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter. </p> <p>Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates. </p> <p>(Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax. This provision applies to distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020. </p> <p>Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 13821) This section modifies the tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to: (1) allow an Alaska Native Corporation to assign certain payments referenced in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to a trust without including the payments in the gross income of the corporation, (2) allow the corporation to elect annually to deduct contributions made to a trust, (3) allow a trust to elect to defer the recognition of gains related to contributions of property other than cash until the sale or exchange of the property, and (4) establish information reporting requirements for deductible contributions to a trust. </p> <p>(Sec. 13822) This section exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. </p> <p>(Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held. </p> <p>Subtitle D--International Tax Provisions </p> <p>Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> <p>Part I--Outbound Transactions </p> <p>Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section. </p> <p>The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception. </p> <p>(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. </p> <p>For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation. </p> <p>The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes. </p> <p>The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings. </p> <p>The tax may be paid in installments over eight years. </p> <p>The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts. </p> <p>Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income </p> <p>Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill. </p> <p>Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments </p> <p>(Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual. </p> <p>The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property. </p> <p>The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. </p> <p>A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill </p> <p>(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends. </p> <p>Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion. </p> <p>(Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries. </p> <p>(Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source. </p> <p>A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss. </p> <p>Part II--Inbound Transactions </p> <p>(Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax. </p> <p>An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers). </p> <p>Part III--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income. </p> <p>TITLE II </p> <p>(Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain.</p> <p>Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program. </p> <p>(Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.</p> <p> (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury. </p> <p>DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. </p>]]></summary-text>

<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>(Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.) </p> <p>TITLE I</p> <p><i>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act </i></p> <p>Subtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform </p> <p>Part I--Tax Rate Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket. </p> <p>The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household. </p> <p>(Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation. </p> <p>Part II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities </p> <p>(Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income. </p> <p>The bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives. </p> <p>The deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction. </p> <p>The bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns). </p> <p>A &quot;specified service trade or business&quot; is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services. </p> <p>(Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses. </p> <p>An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018. </p> <p>In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner's distributive share and each S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in applying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corporation shareholder. </p> <p>Losses prohibited under this section are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years. </p> <p>Part III--Tax Benefits For Families And Individuals </p> <p>(Sec. 11021) This section temporarily increases the standard deduction to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,000 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation after 2018 using the chained CPI. </p> <p>(Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 11022) This section modifies the child tax credit to temporarily: (1) increase the credit to $2,000 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and (2) allow a $500 nonrefundable credit for each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credit is phased out at AGI levels of $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $200,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,400 per qualifying child. In order to receive the credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non-refundable credit is claimed. </p> <p>(Sec. 11023) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to temporarily increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitation for contributions of cash to public charities.</p> <p>(Sec. 11024) This section temporarily increases contribution limitations for ABLE accounts with respect to contributions made by the designated beneficiary of the account. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.) </p> <p>After the limit is reached, the designated beneficiary may contribute an additional amount up to the lesser of: (1) the federal poverty line for a one-person household, or (2) the individual's compensation for the taxable year. </p> <p>The bill also allows the designated beneficiary of an ABLE account to claim the saver's credit for contributions made to his or her account. </p> <p>(Sec. 11025) This section allows funds from qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans) to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of the 529 account or a member of the designated beneficiary's family. </p> <p>(Sec. 11026) This section temporarily allows certain members of the Armed Forces in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to receive combat zone tax benefits for performing services that qualify for special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger. </p> <p>(Sec. 11027) For 2017 and 2018, this section reduces from 10% to 7.5% the AGI threshold that must be exceeded before a taxpayer is allowed to claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 11028) This section provides tax incentives for areas in which a major disaster was declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during calendar year 2016. </p> <p>For individuals residing in the 2016 disaster areas, the bill allows: (1) exceptions to the 10% penalty for up to $100,000 in early withdrawals from retirement plans, and (2) personal casualty losses exceeding $500 per casualty to be deducted without regard to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10% of a taxpayer's AGI. </p> <p>Part IV--Education </p> <p>(Sec. 11031) This section temporarily modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income to exclude from gross income certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student. </p> <p>(Sec. 11032) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be used for expenses for: (1) tuition in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school; and (2) specified expenses in connection with a home school. </p> <p>Part V--Deductions And Exclusions </p> <p>(Sec. 11041) This section: (1) suspends the deduction for personal exemptions, (2) modifies the wage withholding rules, (3) and modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return. </p> <p>(Sec. 11042) This section temporarily limits individual deductions for certain state and local taxes to $10,000 per year ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The limit does not apply to taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income. </p> <p>(Sec. 11043) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) temporarily limit the deduction for debt incurred on or before December 15, 2017, to mortgages of up to $750,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) suspend the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans. </p> <p>For taxable years beginning after 2025, the deduction applies to mortgages of up to $1 million regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred. </p> <p>(Sec. 11044) This section temporarily modifies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. A taxpayer may only claim the deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster.

The bill requires a life insurance company with such an account to pay taxes on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 13515) This section modifies the proration rules for property and casualty insurance companies to replace the 15% reduction with a reduction equal to 5.25% divided by the highest corporate tax rate in effect. (Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.) </p> <p>(Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.) </p> <p>(Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies. </p> <p>(Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company. </p> <p>(Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule, the company's share is 70% and the policyholder's share is 30%. </p> <p>(Sec. 13519) This section modifies the requirements for the capitalization of policy acquisition expenses of insurance companies to extend the amortization period from 120 months to 180 months. </p> <p>Under current law, policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company's general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specified percentage of the net premiums for the year on each of three categories of insurance contracts. </p> <p>The bill increases these percentages from 1.75% to 2.09% for annuity contracts, from 2.05% to 2.45% for group life insurance contracts, and from 7.7% to 9.2% for all other specified insurance contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 13520) This section establishes reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts in a reportable policy sale. It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits. </p> <p>A &quot;reportable policy sale&quot; is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract. </p> <p>(Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract.

The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of &quot;covered employee,&quot; and (3) expands the definition of &quot;publicly held corporation.&quot; </p> <p>The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. </p> <p>(Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>(Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation. </p> <p>Subpart B--Retirement Plans </p> <p>(Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. </p> <p>(Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan. </p> <p>(Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.) </p> <p>The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017. </p> <p>In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution.

The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> <p>Part I--Outbound Transactions </p> <p>Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section. </p> <p>The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception. </p> <p>(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. </p> <p>For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation. </p> <p>The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes. </p> <p>The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings. </p> <p>The tax may be paid in installments over eight years. </p> <p>The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts. </p> <p>Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income </p> <p>Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill. </p> <p>Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments </p> <p>(Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual. </p> <p>The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property. </p> <p>The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. </p> <p>A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill </p> <p>(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends. </p> <p>Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion. </p> <p>(Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries. </p> <p>(Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source. </p> <p>A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss. </p> <p>Part II--Inbound Transactions </p> <p>(Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax. </p> <p>An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers). </p> <p>Part III--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income. </p> <p>TITLE II </p> <p>(Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain.</p> <p>Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program. </p> <p>(Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.</p> <p> (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury. </p> <p>DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. </p>]]></summary-text>

<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 13, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)</p> <p><b>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. </p> <p>TITLE I--TAX REFORM FOR INDIVIDUALS </p> <p>Subtitle A--Simplification and Reform of Rates, Standard Deduction, and Exemptions </p> <p>(Sec. 1001) This section replaces the seven existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with four brackets (12%, 25%, 35%, and 39.6%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket. </p> <p>Under the bill, most of the income that is currently included in the 10% and 15% brackets is taxed at 12%, and most of the income currently included in the 25% and 28% brackets is taxed at 25%. The bill also raises the threshold for income that is taxed at the 39.6% rate. </p> <p>The bill imposes an additional tax on taxpayers with adjusted gross income that exceeds $1 million ($1.2 million for married taxpayers filing jointly) by phasing out the benefit of the 12% tax bracket, as measured against the 39.6% bracket. </p> <p>The bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation. </p> <p>(Sec. 1002) This section increases the standard deduction to $24,400 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,300 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,200 for all other taxpayers. (Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 1003) This section: (1) repeals the deduction for personal exemptions (2) modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return, and (3) repeals the increased deduction for qualified disability trusts. </p> <p>(Sec. 1004) This section establishes a maximum 25% rate on the qualified business income of individuals (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates.) </p> <p>Qualified business income is all net business income from a passive business activity plus the capital percentage of net business income from an active business activity, reduced by carryover business losses and by certain net business losses from the current year, as specified in the bill. </p> <p>The bill provides a reduced tax rate for certain small businesses with net active business income below an indexed threshold of $75,000 for married individuals filing jointly. The amount taxed at the rate is reduced by the excess of taxable income over an indexed threshold of $150,000. </p> <p>(Sec. 1005) This section makes several conforming changes related to the modified individual tax rates. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Simplification and Reform of Family and Individual Tax Credits </p> <p>(Sec. 1101) This section increases the child tax credit and expands it to include a new family tax credit. </p> <p>The bill allows credits of: $1,600 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and $300 for the taxpayer (both spouses in the case of married taxpayers filing a joint return) and each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credits are phased out at adjusted gross income (AGI) levels of $230,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $115,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,000 per qualifying child, adjusted for inflation after 2017. The $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents of the taxpayer expires after 2022. </p> <p>(Sec. 1102) This section repeals the nonrefundable credits for: (1) taxpayers who are over 65 or retired on the account of permanent and total disability, (2) interest on certain home mortgages covered by a mortgage credit certificate issued by a qualified governmental unit, and (3) new plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. </p> <p>(Sec. 1103) This section modifies the taxpayer identification number requirements for the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit (EITC), and the American Opportunity tax credit. </p> <p>(Sec. 1104) This section specifies that a taxpayer must claim all allowable deductions when determining net earnings from self-employment for the purpose of the EITC. </p> <p>It also modifies the requirements for employer reporting of wages to require employers to report, along with the aggregate wages paid and employment taxes collected, the name and address of each employee and the amount of reportable wages received by each of those employees. </p> <p>(Sec. 1105) This section limits earned income, for purposes of the EITC, to amounts substantiated by the taxpayer on statements furnished or returns filed under third party information reporting requirements or amounts substantiated by the taxpayer's books and records. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Simplification and Reform of Education Incentives </p> <p>(Sec. 1201) This section repeals the Lifetime Learning credit and modifies the American Opportunity credit, which, under current law, may both be used for qualified tuition and related expenses. </p> <p>The modified American Opportunity credit may be claimed with respect to a student for five taxable years (four years under current law). For a credit claimed with respect to the student's fifth taxable year, the credit is half the value of the American Opportunity credit that is applicable to the first four taxable years. A student may claim the credit for any of the first five years of postsecondary education. </p> <p>(Sec. 1202) This section consolidates and modifies several provisions regarding education savings accounts to replace Coverdell savings accounts with modified rules for tax-exempt qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans). </p> <p>The bill prohibits new contributions to Coverdell savings accounts after 2017. Rollovers from one Coverdell savings account to another are permitted after this date. 529 plans may receive rollovers from Coverdell savings accounts. </p> <p>The bill modifies 529 plans to allow the plans to distribute up to $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred during the taxable year in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, private, or religious elementary or secondary school. The $10,000 limitation applies on a per-student basis for distributions from all 529 accounts. </p> <p>The bill also modifies 529 plans to: (1) allow distributions to be used for certain expenses required for attendance in a registered apprenticeship program, and (2) specify that an unborn child may qualify as a designated beneficiary. </p> <p>(Sec. 1203) This section modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income, to include within the exclusion certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student. </p> <p>The section also modifies the gross income exclusion for amounts received under the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program or certain state loan repayment programs to include any amount received by an individual under the Indian Health Service loan repayment program. </p> <p>(Sec. 1204) This section repeals several education-related deductions and exclusions, including: </p> <ul> <li> the deduction for interest on education loans, </li> <li> the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, </li> <li> the exclusion for income from U.S. savings bonds used to pay higher education tuition and fees, </li> <li> the exclusion for educational assistance programs, and</li> <li>the exclusion for qualified tuition reductions. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 1205) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of that 529 account, or a member of the designated beneficiary's family. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.) </p> <p>Subtitle D--Simplification and Reform of Deductions </p> <p>(Sec. 1301) This section repeals the overall limitation on itemized deductions, which currently applies when AGI exceeds a specified amount. </p> <p>(Sec. 1302) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) limit the deduction for debt incurred after November 2, 2017, to mortgages of up to $500,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) prohibit the deduction from being used for interest paid on home equity loans. </p> <p>(Sec. 1303) For individual taxpayers, this section prohibits the deductions for state, local, and foreign real property taxes; and state and local personal property taxes unless the taxes are paid or accrued in a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income. </p> <p>The bill includes an exception that allows an individual to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes, in addition to taxes that may be deducted because they are paid or accrued in a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income. </p> <p>The bill also repeals the deduction for state and local income, war profits, and excess profits taxes of individuals. </p> <p>(Sec. 1304) This section repeals the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses, with an exception for the deduction, as modified by the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, for individuals who sustained a personal casualty loss as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, or Maria. </p> <p>(Sec. 1305) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions. The bill specifies that &quot;losses from wagering transactions&quot; include otherwise deductible expenses incurred in carrying out a wagering transaction (e.g., expenses for traveling to or from a casino). </p> <p>(Sec. 1306) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to: (1) increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitations for contributions of cash to public charities, (2) prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights, (3) replace the statutory charitable mileage rate of 14 cents per mile with a rate that takes into account the variable cost of operating an automobile (adjusted for inflation), (4) repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization. </p> <p>(Sec. 1307) This section repeals the deduction for expenses paid or incurred in connection with determination, collection, or refund of any tax. </p> <p>(Sec. 1308) This section repeals the deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 1309) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payer spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse. </p> <p>(Sec. 1310) This section repeals the deduction for moving expenses, with an exception for moving expense of members of the Armed Forces. </p> <p>(Sec. 1311) This section repeals the deductions and exclusions for contributions to Archer Medical Savings Accounts. </p> <p>(Sec. 1312) This section prohibits any deduction for expenses attributable to the trade or business of being an employee, except for expenses that are deductible from gross income (above-the-line deductions). </p> <p>This section also repeals the above-the-line deductions for: (1) certain expenses of performing artists;

(Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.) </p> <p>(Sec. 1003) This section: (1) repeals the deduction for personal exemptions (2) modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return, and (3) repeals the increased deduction for qualified disability trusts. </p> <p>(Sec. 1004) This section establishes a maximum 25% rate on the qualified business income of individuals (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates.) </p> <p>Qualified business income is all net business income from a passive business activity plus the capital percentage of net business income from an active business activity, reduced by carryover business losses and by certain net business losses from the current year, as specified in the bill. </p> <p>The bill provides a reduced tax rate for certain small businesses with net active business income below an indexed threshold of $75,000 for married individuals filing jointly. The amount taxed at the rate is reduced by the excess of taxable income over an indexed threshold of $150,000. </p> <p>(Sec. 1005) This section makes several conforming changes related to the modified individual tax rates. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Simplification and Reform of Family and Individual Tax Credits </p> <p>(Sec. 1101) This section increases the child tax credit and expands it to include a new family tax credit. </p> <p>The bill allows credits of: $1,600 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and $300 for the taxpayer (both spouses in the case of married taxpayers filing a joint return) and each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. </p> <p>The credits are phased out at adjusted gross income (AGI) levels of $230,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $115,000 for individuals. </p> <p>The refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,000 per qualifying child, adjusted for inflation after 2017. The $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents of the taxpayer expires after 2022. </p> <p>(Sec. 1102) This section repeals the nonrefundable credits for: (1) taxpayers who are over 65 or retired on the account of permanent and total disability, (2) interest on certain home mortgages covered by a mortgage credit certificate issued by a qualified governmental unit, and (3) new plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. </p> <p>(Sec. 1103) This section modifies the taxpayer identification number requirements for the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit (EITC), and the American Opportunity tax credit. </p> <p>(Sec. 1104) This section specifies that a taxpayer must claim all allowable deductions when determining net earnings from self-employment for the purpose of the EITC. </p> <p>It also modifies the requirements for employer reporting of wages to require employers to report, along with the aggregate wages paid and employment taxes collected, the name and address of each employee and the amount of reportable wages received by each of those employees. </p> <p>(Sec. 1105) This section limits earned income, for purposes of the EITC, to amounts substantiated by the taxpayer on statements furnished or returns filed under third party information reporting requirements or amounts substantiated by the taxpayer's books and records. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Simplification and Reform of Education Incentives </p> <p>(Sec. 1201) This section repeals the Lifetime Learning credit and modifies the American Opportunity credit, which, under current law, may both be used for qualified tuition and related expenses. </p> <p>The modified American Opportunity credit may be claimed with respect to a student for five taxable years (four years under current law). For a credit claimed with respect to the student's fifth taxable year, the credit is half the value of the American Opportunity credit that is applicable to the first four taxable years. A student may claim the credit for any of the first five years of postsecondary education. </p> <p>(Sec. 1202) This section consolidates and modifies several provisions regarding education savings accounts to replace Coverdell savings accounts with modified rules for tax-exempt qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans). </p> <p>The bill prohibits new contributions to Coverdell savings accounts after 2017. Rollovers from one Coverdell savings account to another are permitted after this date. 529 plans may receive rollovers from Coverdell savings accounts. </p> <p>The bill modifies 529 plans to allow the plans to distribute up to $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred during the taxable year in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, private, or religious elementary or secondary school. The $10,000 limitation applies on a per-student basis for distributions from all 529 accounts. </p> <p>The bill also modifies 529 plans to: (1) allow distributions to be used for certain expenses required for attendance in a registered apprenticeship program, and (2) specify that an unborn child may qualify as a designated beneficiary. </p> <p>(Sec. 1203) This section modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income, to include within the exclusion certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student. </p> <p>The section also modifies the gross income exclusion for amounts received under the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program or certain state loan repayment programs to include any amount received by an individual under the Indian Health Service loan repayment program. </p> <p>(Sec. 1204) This section repeals several education-related deductions and exclusions, including: </p> <ul> <li> the deduction for interest on education loans, </li> <li> the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, </li> <li> the exclusion for income from U.S. savings bonds used to pay higher education tuition and fees, </li> <li> the exclusion for educational assistance programs, and</li> <li>the exclusion for qualified tuition reductions. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 1205) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of that 529 account, or a member of the designated beneficiary's family.

The tax is equal to 20% of the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 3803) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) have been one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>TITLE IV--TAXATION OF FOREIGN INCOME AND FOREIGN PERSONS </p> <p>Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This title establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> Subtitle A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income <p>(Sec. 4001) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section</p> <p>The bill establishes a six-month holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section applies the participation exemption to investments in U.S. property by specifying that the tax for CFC investments in U.S. property with respect to a domestic corporation is zero. </p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section specifies that, solely for the purpose of determining a loss, a domestic corporate shareholder's adjusted basis in the stock of a specified 10% owned foreign corporation is reduced by the portion of any dividend received with respect to such stock from such foreign corporation that was not taxed by reason of a dividends received deduction. </p> <p>If a domestic corporation transfers substantially all of the assets of a foreign branch to a foreign corporation which, after such transfer, is a specified 10% owned foreign corporation with respect to which the domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder, the domestic corporation must include in gross income an amount equal to the transferred loss amount, subject to certain limitations. </p> <p>(Sec. 4004) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. The bill deems the earnings to be repatriated and impose taxes of: (1) 14% for earnings held in liquid form, and (2) 7% for accumulated foreign earnings that have been reinvested in the foreign subsidiary's business. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 4101) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion.</p> <p>(Sec. 4102) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Modification of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 4201) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments. </p> <p>(Sec. 4202) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 4203) This section adds an inflation adjustment for the de minimis exception for foreign base company income. </p> <p>(Sec. 4204) The provision makes permanent the exclusion from foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued by one CFC from a related CFC. </p> <p>(Sec. 4205) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation.</p> <p>(Sec. 4206) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Subtitle D--Prevention of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 4301) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC to include in gross income 50% of shareholder's foreign high return amount for the year, as calculated using a formula specified in this bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 4302) This section limits the deduction for interest expenses of domestic corporations which are members of an international financial reporting group. </p> <p>For a domestic corporation which is a member of any international financial reporting group, the deduction for interest paid or accrued during the year may not exceed the sum of the member's interest income plus the allowable percentage of 110% of net interest expense. </p> <p>An &quot;international financial reporting group&quot; is a group that: (1) includes at least one foreign corporation engaged in a U.S. trade or business or at least one domestic corporation and one foreign corporation at any time during the group's reporting year, (2) prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance specified principles or standards, and (3) has average annual gross receipts that exceed $100 million. </p> <p>(Sec. 4303) This section imposes a 20% excise tax on payments from domestic corporations to related foreign corporations to the extent that the amounts are deductible by the U.S. payor. The excise tax does not apply if the foreign recipient elects to be subject to U.S. income tax on the amounts received. </p> <p>Subtitle E--Provisions Related to Possessions of the United States </p> <p>(Sec. 4401) This section extends the rules that apply to the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities in Puerto Rico.</p> <p> (Sec. 4402) This section extends for six years the increase in the limit on the amount of excise taxes on rum covered over to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. (Under the provision, the limitation of $13.25 per proof gallon is extended for rum brought into the United States after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2023. After December 31, 2022, the limit reverts to $10.50 per proof gallon.) </p> <p>(Sec. 4403) This section extends the American Samoa economic development credit for five years. </p> <p>Subtitle F--Other International Reforms </p> <p>(Sec. 4501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>TITLE V--EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS </p> <p>Subtitle A--Unrelated Business Income Tax </p> <p>(Sec. 5001) This section specifies that a tax-exempt organization does not fail to be subject to tax on its unrelated business income solely because the organization also is exempt, or excludes amounts from gross income, by reason of another provision of the IRC. </p> <p>(Sec. 5002) This section modifies the exclusion of research income from the tax on unrelated business income to limit the exclusion to fundamental research the results of which are freely available to the general public. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Excise Taxes </p> <p>(Sec. 5101) This section replaces the two excise tax rates for the net investment income of tax-exempt private foundations with a single tax rate of 1.4%. It repeals the reduced excise tax rate for private foundations that exceed their historical level of qualifying distributions. </p> <p>(Sec. 5102) This section prohibits an organization that operates an art museum as a substantial activity from qualifying as a private operating foundation unless the museum is open during normal business hours to the public for at least 1,000 hours during the taxable year. </p> <p>(Sec. 5103) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities that have at least 500 students. </p> <p>(Sec. 5104) This section creates an exception to the excise taxes on excess business holdings for the holdings of a private foundation in any business enterprise that meets specified requirements relating to exclusive ownership, minimum distribution of net operating income for the charitable purpose (all profits to charity distribution requirement), and independent operation (not controlled by a substantial contributor or family members) from the excise taxes on excess business holdings. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Requirements for Organizations Exempt From Tax </p> <p>(Sec. 5201) This section permits a tax-exempt organization to make certain statements related to a political campaign without losing its tax-exempt status. </p> <p>An organization may not lose its tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) or be deemed to have participated in, or intervened in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, solely because of the content of any statement that: (1) is made in the ordinary course of the organization's regular and customary activities in carrying out its exempt purpose, and (2) results in the organization incurring not more than de minimis incremental expenses. </p> <p>(Sec. 5202) This section establishes additional reporting requirements for organizations that sponsor donor advised funds. (A donor advised fund is a fund or account that is separately identified by reference to contributions of a donor or donors. The account is owned and controlled by a sponsoring charitable organization, while the donor retains advisory privileges with respect to the distribution and investment of funds in the account.) </p>]]></summary-text>
