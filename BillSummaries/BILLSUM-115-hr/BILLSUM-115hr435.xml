<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Credit Access and Inclusion Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow the reporting of certain positive consumer-credit information to consumer reporting agencies. Specifically, a person or the Department of Housing and Urban Development may report information related to&nbsp;a consumer's performance&nbsp;in making payments either under a lease agreement for a dwelling or pursuant to a contract for a utility or telecommunications service. However, information about a consumer's usage of any utility or telecommunications service may be reported only to the extent that the information relates to payment by the consumer for such service or other terms of the provision of that service. Furthermore, an energy-utility firm may not report a consumer's outstanding balance as late if the firm and the consumer have entered into a payment plan and the consumer is meeting the obligations of that plan.</p> <p>Specified provisions of the Consumer Credit Protection Act&nbsp;that&nbsp;establish&nbsp;civil liability&nbsp;with respect to&nbsp;furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies shall not apply to any violation of the bill.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must report on the consumer impact of such reporting.</p>]]></summary-text>
