<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Community Mortgage Lender Regulatory Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to specify that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may audit, investigate, or take an enforcement action against a responsible community mortgage lender other than a depository institution or credit union, but only if requested to do so by one of several specified regulators or agencies. A "responsible community mortgage lender" is one that: (1)&nbsp;meets certain&nbsp;restrictions with respect to number and volume of mortgage loan originations and amount of either assets or net worth; and (2) has not, with respect to its mortgage loan originations and within a specified time frame,&nbsp;been subject to a cease and desist order or found by a court to have violated the law. </p> <p>Furthermore, the CFPB and other federal banking agencies are prohibited from requiring such a lender to audit&nbsp;one of its&nbsp;vendors or third-party contractors unless the CFPB or other agency&nbsp;has reasonable cause to believe that the vendor or contractor is&nbsp;causing the lender to violate the law.</p>]]></summary-text>
