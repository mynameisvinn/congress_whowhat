<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rechecking Eligibility of Applicants to the Lifeline Program to Prevent Losses Yearly Act of 2017 or the REAPPLY Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to require telecommunications carriers that provide Lifeline services to require Lifeline subscribers to re-apply for the service every 12 months&nbsp;in order for the carriers to receive federal reimbursement for providing&nbsp;such services. (Lifeline is the federal government program to provide telecommunications services to low-income individuals. Current federal regulations require telecommunications carriers to annually&nbsp;certify that&nbsp;their Lifeline subscribers are still eligible for the service.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></summary-text>
