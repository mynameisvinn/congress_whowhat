<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Public Option Deficit Reduction Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to offer a public health insurance option that ensures choice, competition, and stability of affordable, high-quality coverage throughout the United States. The bill declares that HHS's primary responsibility is to create a low-cost plan without compromising quality or access to care.</p> <p>The bill sets forth provisions related to the establishment and governance of the public health insurance option, including that plans under the option must: (1) be offered only through health insurance exchanges; (2) comply with requirements for plans offered through exchanges, including requirements related to benefits, benefit levels, provider networks, notices, consumer protections, and cost sharing; and (3) include plans with bronze, silver, and gold tier benefits.</p> <p>HHS must: (1) establish an office of the ombudsman for the public health insurance option; (2) collect data to establish premiums and payment rates; (3) establish geographically adjusted premiums at a level sufficient to fully finance the costs of the health benefits provided, administrative costs, and a contingency margin; and (4) establish payment rates for health care providers at Medicare rates, with higher rates for the first three years.</p> <p>The bill appropriates funding for the establishment of the public health insurance option. HHS must repay this amount over 10 years.</p> <p>HHS may use innovative payment mechanisms and policies to determine payments for items and services under the public health insurance option.</p>]]></summary-text>
