<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Community Trust Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill nullifies Executive Order 13768, entitled &quot;Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,&quot; beginning on January 25, 2017, and prohibits the use of any federal funds to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out any of the policy changes set forth in such order. Among other things, that order raises questions regarding whether, and to what extent, federal agencies will withhold federal grant funds that would have otherwise been awarded to jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with a federal statute that bars states and localities from restricting sending or receiving information to or from federal immigration authorities (sanctuary jurisdictions).</p>]]></summary-text>
