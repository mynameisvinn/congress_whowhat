<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the federal criminal code to require any health care practitioner who is present when a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion to: (1) exercise the same degree of care as reasonably provided to any other child born alive at the same gestational age, and (2) ensure that such child is immediately admitted to a hospital. The term &quot;born alive&quot; means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut.</p> <p>Also, a health care practitioner or other employee who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements must immediately report such failure to an appropriate law enforcement agency. </p> <p>An individual who violates the provisions of this bill is subject to a criminal fine, up to five years in prison, or both. </p> <p>An individual who commits an overt act that kills a child born alive is subject to criminal prosecution for murder.</p> <p>The bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of felony. </p> <p>A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill. </p> <p>]]></summary-text>
