<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Flood and Agriculture Risk Management Cost Reduction Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to allow, under the National Flood Insurance Program, certain local variances with respect to agricultural structures located in special flood-hazard zones. The chargeable premium rate for coverage with respect to a structure that is provided such a variance shall be the same&nbsp;as would otherwise apply if the structure had been dry flood-proofed.</p> <p>If a community applies to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the remapping of a levee-impacted area in which the pertinent levee system fails to meet specified minimum standards for accreditation on a flood-insurance rate map: (1) FEMA must establish, on an alternative map,&nbsp;a flood-risk zone for the area; and (2) flood insurance shall be made available, at specified risk-based rates,&nbsp;to properties located within the zone.</p> <p>FEMA&nbsp;shall carry out a pilot program that provides for the sale of contracts for flood-insurance coverage, under the National Flood Insurance Program, for multiple nonresidential agricultural structures under a single policy.</p>]]></summary-text>
