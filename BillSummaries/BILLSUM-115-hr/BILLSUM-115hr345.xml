<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Stop Foreign Influence Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the federal criminal code to impose a 10-year post-employment lobbying ban on a former President, Vice President, Member of Congress, or specified intelligence appointee who knowingly represents, or aids or advises, a country of particular concern. The term &quot;country of particular concern&quot; means: (1) a country designated by the Department of State to be of particular concern for religious freedom violations, and (2) any entity owned or controlled by such country. </p> <p>Additionally, the bill amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to revise the definition of &quot;lobbyist.&quot; Currently, a lobbyist is an individual who: (1) is employed or retained by a client for compensation, (2) makes more than one lobbying contact, and (3) spends at least 20% of the time working for that client on lobbying activities. This bill broadens the definition to include, as a lobbyist, an individual who spends less than 20% of the time working for that client on lobbying activities, if the client is a country of particular concern and if the individual is a former President, Vice President, Member of Congress, or specified intelligence appointee. </p>]]></summary-text>
