<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Recall Unsafe Drugs Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require producers of medications to notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the identity and location of a medication if the producer has reason to believe: (1) that the medication is adulterated or misbranded; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that the use or consumption of, or exposure to, the medication will cause a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.</p> <p>The FDA may: (1) request that the distributor of a medication that is in violation of the FFDCA voluntarily recall the medication; (2) require the distributor of a medication that may cause serious adverse health consequences to immediately cease distribution of the medication; (3) recall a medication for which distribution has been ceased after giving the distributor an opportunity for an informal hearing; and (4) immediately recall a medication that presents an imminent threat of serious adverse health consequences. Distributors may appeal these FDA orders.</p> <p>In the case of a recall, the FDA must notify consumers and state and local health officials to whom the medication was, or may have been, distributed.</p> <p>Medication distributors must have a recall plan in effect.</p>]]></summary-text>
