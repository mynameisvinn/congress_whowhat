<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Financial Literacy to Financial Freedom Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify loan counseling requirements for an institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs.</p> <p>Currently, an IHE must provide one-time entrance counseling to a student who is a first-time Direct Loan (DL) program borrower.
