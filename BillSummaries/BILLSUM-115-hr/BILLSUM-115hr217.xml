<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) to provide federal family planning grants only to entities that certify that, during the period of the grant, they will not perform abortions or provide funds to entities that perform abortions. Exceptions are made for abortions where: (1) the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; or (2) a physician certifies that the woman suffered from a physical disorder, injury, or illness that would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy. Hospitals are exempted unless they provide funds to non-hospital entities that perform abortions.</p> <p>HHS must include in an annual report: (1) information on grantees who performed abortions under the exceptions, and (2) a list of entities to which grant funds are made available. </p>]]></summary-text>
