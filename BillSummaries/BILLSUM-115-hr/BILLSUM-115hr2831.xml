<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maritime Security Coordination Improvement Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), by 270 days after this bill's enactment: (1) and every three years thereafter, to submit an update of the strategic plan to enhance the security of the international supply chain; and (2) to report on the effectiveness of, and need for any improvements to, the Container Security Initiative.</p> <p>The bill requires an Area Maritime Security Advisory Committee to facilitate the sharing of information relating to cybersecurity risks and incidents to address port-specific cybersecurity risks and incidents.</p> <p>DHS's facility and vessel vulnerability assessments shall include identification of weaknesses in cybersecurity. </p> <p>The security plan submitted by an owner or operator of a vessel or facility for deterring a transportation security incident shall include provisions for prevention, management, and response to cybersecurity risks and incidents. DHS must verify the effectiveness of each such plan at least once (currently, twice) a year, and more frequently as necessary, in a risk-based manner.</p> <p>The bill requires DHS, at least 30 days before signing an arrangement with a foreign government providing for mutual recognition of supply chain security practices which might result in the utilization of benefits offered to Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 participants in the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), to: (1) notify Congress of the proposed terms, and (2) determine that such government's program provides comparable security as that provided by C-TPAT.</p> <p>The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct DHS, within 180 days and biennially thereafter, to submit to Congress a maritime operations coordination plan.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office shall report on the state of the Coast Guard's Deployable Specialized Forces.</p> <p>DHS shall conduct a cost-benefit analysis, for any location in which U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Air and Marine Operations is based within 45 miles of locations where any other DHS agency also operates air and marine assets, to consider the potential cost and savings from co-locating the operational assets of such office at facilities where such other DHS agencies operate such assets. </p> <p>The bill repeals provisions requiring DHS to establish: (1) interagency operational centers for port security at all high-priority ports, and (2) a program to evaluate and certify secure systems of international intermodal transportation.</p>]]></summary-text>
