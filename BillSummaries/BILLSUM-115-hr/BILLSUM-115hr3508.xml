<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt small partnerships from certain requirements relating to tax returns. The exception applies to any partnership having 10 or fewer partners, each of whom is an individual (other than a nonresident alien), a C corporation, or an estate of a deceased partner. For the purpose of the exception, a husband and wife (and their estates) must be treated as one partner. </p> <p>The bill allows a partnership to elect to have deficiency procedures apply to the assessment or collection of any underpayment of tax attributable to certain adjustments involving a change in a partner's distributive share of the amount of any partnership item shown on the partnership return. </p>]]></summary-text>
