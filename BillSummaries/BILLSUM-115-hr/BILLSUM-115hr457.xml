<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>VA Appeals Modernization Act of 2017</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits appeals process to permit a claimant to request: </p> <ul> <li>a review of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's decision by a higher-level adjudicator within the agency under which no additional evidence may be submitted; or </li> <li>a Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) review under which no BVA hearing is requested and no additional evidence may be submitted or under which a BVA hearing is requested and the appellant requests an opportunity to submit additional evidence at, and within 90 days of, the hearing. </li> </ul> <p> ("Agency of Original Jurisdiction" means the activity which entered the original determination with regard to a claim for veterans benefits.)</p> <p>The BVA shall maintain two such separate dockets.</p> <p>A finding favorable to a claimant is binding on all subsequent VA adjudicators unless clear and convincing evidence is shown to the contrary. </p> <p>The BVA may remand a claim to the agency to obtain a corrective advisory medical opinion. </p> <p>The bill revises effective dates of awards provisions.</p> <p>The VA's duty to assist a claimant shall not apply: (1) once the claimant is provided notice of the agency's initial decision, and (2) to higher-level agency or BVA review.</p> <p>The VA is not required to send notice for a supplemental claim or to readjudicate a claim that has been disallowed except when new and relevant evidence is presented or secured (currently such provisions applies to reopening such claim).</p> <p>A claimants's notice of disagreement must set out specific allegations of error of fact or law. The BVA is authorized to dismiss an appeal which fails to do so.</p>]]></summary-text>
