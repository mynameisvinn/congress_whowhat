<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Prohibiting Detention of Youth Status Offenders Act of 2017</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to modify the deinstitutionalization of status offenders (DSO) core requirement with which a state must comply to receive funds under the Formula Grant Program. The DSO core requirement prohibits the secure detention or confinement of a juvenile who commits a status offense (i.e., an offense that would not be a crime if committed by an adult).</p> <p>This bill eliminates an exception to the DSO core requirement that permits the secure detention or confinement of an out-of-state runaway youth.</p> <p>It also eliminates, not later than one year after enactment, an exception to the DSO core requirement that permits the secure detention or confinement of a juvenile status offender who violates a valid court order. Until then, use of the valid court order exception to securely detain or confine a juvenile status offender must comply with additional requirements, such as issuance of a written court order and a three-day maximum length of detention.</p>]]></summary-text>
