<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Subsidy Reserve Act of 2017</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve&nbsp;Board (FRB)&nbsp;and each bank holding company with total consolidated assets of at least $500 billion to establish and maintain a capital&nbsp;account called a "subsidy reserve." The amount in a company's subsidy reserve shall be based, according to a formula established by the FRB, on the financial benefit received by the company as a result of the expectation of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties that the federal government will shield them from losses in the event of the company's failure. The amount in a company's subsidy reserve may be taken into account&nbsp;for purposes of determining a company's compliance with&nbsp;regulatory capital requirements.</p>]]></summary-text>
