<summary-text><![CDATA[<p> <b><b>Employee Fairness and Relief Act of 2017</b></b></p> <p>This bill permits a health insurer that had in effect health insurance coverage in the small group market in 2013 to offer that coverage outside of health insurance exchanges. That coverage is treated as a grandfathered health plan and thus fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.</p>]]></summary-text>
