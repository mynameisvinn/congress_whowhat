<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Preserving Taxpayers' Rights Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish new procedures and requirements for administrative appeals of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) deficiency determinations. </p> <p>If the IRS determines that there is a deficiency with respect to a tax imposed, it may send a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer after: </p> <ul> <li> the taxpayer has been issued a letter of proposed deficiency that explains the basis for the determination of deficiency and provides an opportunity for administrative review in the IRS Office of Appeals; and </li> <li>either: (1) the time provided in the letter for requesting administrative review in the office has expired and the taxpayer has not made such a request, or (2) the office has officially concluded the administrative review process with respect to the deficiency. </li> </ul> <p>The bill includes exceptions to these requirements for frivolous tax positions and issues in cases designated for litigation. </p> <p>The IRS must permit a taxpayer to appeal a deficiency prior to issuing a deficiency notice if 60 or fewer days remain on the statute of limitations and the taxpayer agrees to extend the period for 12 months. </p> <p>The bill modifies appeals dispute resolution procedures. It also restricts the authority of the IRS to: (1) designate cases for litigation without permitting an appeal, or (2) offer settlement agreements that preclude an appeal. </p> <p>The bill modifies the authority of the IRS to issue a summons and limits the access that people outside of the IRS have to returns and return information acquired by a summons. </p>]]></summary-text>
