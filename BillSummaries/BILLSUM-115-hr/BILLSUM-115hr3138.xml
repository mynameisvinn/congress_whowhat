It makes those tribes and tribal organizations eligible to participate in the program that collects past-due support from individual tax refunds. </p> <p>An Indian tribal government may determine whether a child has special needs for the purpose of the tax credit for the adoption of a child with special needs. </p>]]></summary-text>
