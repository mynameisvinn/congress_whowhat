<paragraph id="H13D56540F49A4754AF5B20D6ADF6BF3F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Federal Government spends nearly 75 percent of its annual information technology funding on operating and maintaining existing legacy information technology systems. These systems can pose operational risks, including rising costs and inability to meet mission requirements. These systems also pose security risks, including the inability to use current security best practices, such as data encryption and multi-factor authentication, making these systems particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber activity.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H71F3F55155D3439CAAEE5814E9E7F169"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations to its biannual High Risk List and identified as a particular concern the increasing level of information technology spending on operations and maintenance, making less funding available for development or modernization. The GAO also found the Government has spent billions on failed and poorly performing information technology investments due to a lack of effective oversight.</text></paragraph>
