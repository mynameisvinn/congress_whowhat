 <paragraph id="H4AFDE91A873B4E72A91E4A1A66223FDC"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012 the national unemployment rate for individuals ages 25 years and older with a bachelor’s degree was 4.5 percent and 6.2 percent for individuals with an associate’s degree. For college graduates ages 18 to 25 the national unemployment rate in 2012 was higher at 7.7 percent. Because the typical college graduates leaves college owing an average of $29,400 in student loan debt, a rate that has increased 6 percent every year since 2008, the current job market offers exceedingly few opportunities for such graduates to obtain employment at a salary adequate to service their college loan debt.</text>
