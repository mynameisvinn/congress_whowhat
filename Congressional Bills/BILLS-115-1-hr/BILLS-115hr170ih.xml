 <paragraph id="H091006BA6F81429A9F7668D6E33441E3"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The H–1B visa program allows businesses temporarily to hire highly skilled foreign workers with specialized knowledge, where a qualified worker in the United States cannot be found.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB50B73628AA54A5DA50EDAB0BC23DAA0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In 1990, the Congress created the H–1B visa program to help ensure that access to qualified highly skilled professionals was not an obstacle to economic growth and job creation in the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD4C3FC9D71E4439E872EA83BAD3756C7"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The H–1B visa program was never intended to be used as a catalyst for laying off workers in the United States and replacing them with H–1B workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H098A1E9786954E4DA495C0F224F2262E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The unintended consequences of the H–1B visa program enabled a small number of companies to hire large numbers of H–1B workers relative to their United States worker populations.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF0C5C62C3BB24A499C155EA32807E77C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In 1998, Congress passed new enforcement provisions to the H–1B program in order to prevent companies from displacing United States workers with lower-cost foreign professionals.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3C9A4DCAE3C1424BB994837A7098D0C8"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The 1998 revisions defined a new class of H–1B-dependent employers and established additional conditions on their business and hiring practices unless they paid sufficiently high wages.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCAD84258646A472EA2E63FB0DAD26FFE"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The 1998 revisions, however, did not index wage requirements to keep pace with wage growth, and, as a result, the strength of provisions designed to protect workers and employers committed to hiring United States workers was reduced significantly.</text>
 </paragraph></section><section id="H83BE3AD8132C4AA88FB62E9EDF74F7C5"><enum>3.</enum><header>Purpose</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The purpose of this Act is to close a loophole in the H–1B visa program by requiring H–1B-dependent employers once again to pay sufficiently high wages to ensure the protection of the workforce in the United States and to remove other impediments to proper H–1B visa enforcement.</text>
