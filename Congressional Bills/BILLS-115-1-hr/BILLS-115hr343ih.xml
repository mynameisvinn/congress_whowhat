 </paragraph><paragraph id="H26D2EAF8AB124DB186F9A873E97D6A1D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>A lack of access to public parks and recreation areas and facilities, as well as deteriorating and unsafe play areas, leads to an increase in physical inactivity, which in turn contributes to higher rates of obesity.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H11C4C42AF3C84DE5AF40F1E150002987"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over the past 25 years, rates of obesity have more than tripled among adolescents ages 12 to 19 and doubled among adults ages 20 to 74 and children ages 6 to 11.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE5ADE42DABB2470385EFDF2888FD03B8"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Obesity and related health problems put a strain on our Nation’s economy, as the annual costs of medical spending and lost productivity from individuals in the United States being obese and overweight are estimated to be $147,000,000,000.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9E2D3F313F3747359063314C89ADA4E2"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A study by the Centers for Disease Control found that the creation of, or enhanced access to, places for physical activity, such as parks, led to a 25.6 percent increase in the percentage of people exercising on 3 or more days a week, which improves the physical and mental health of our citizens.</text>

Urban parks decrease juvenile delinquency by providing quality after-school programs during these critical hours.</text>

While cities currently spend tens of billions of dollars on treatment of storm water runoff and air pollution, studies have shown that parkland saves cities millions of dollars in storm water management and air pollution expenses by capturing precipitation, reducing runoff, and absorbing air pollutants.</text>
