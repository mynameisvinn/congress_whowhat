<paragraph id="H8FEF13E07E1E4626A58F10DAB04DF2EC"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Black men and boys face disproportionate hardships that result in disparities in areas including: education, criminal justice, health, employment, fatherhood, mentorship, and violence. These hardships have negative consequences for national productivity, especially for Black families and communities.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H87D467BD52914918843928988FA6654D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>A Commission to study and examine issues which disproportionately have a negative impact on Black men and boys in America will signal that the issues facing the Black male population are a national priority, will develop solutions to these hardships, and will help eliminate the obstacles facing Black men and boys.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H1344E7C963EE4B6FAFB5B05129003477"><enum>(3)</enum><text>A Commission will also be able to investigate potential civil rights violations affecting this population that attract national attention.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4197E92A710A4C1F94DFED1E0321F954"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Black babies are three times more likely to be born in poverty and rapidly fall behind their White counterparts in cognitive development.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H3860C5B09BD642708336C2C18793EAF2"><enum>(5)</enum><text>By fourth grade, Black students are expected to be three years behind White male students. According to the Educational Testing Service Policy Informational Center, only 12 percent of Black eighth-grade male students are proficient in math, compared to 44 percent of White eighth-grade male students.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE94F1D84D7334A7BB6F44C5FCDA38907"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Educational Testing Service Policy Informational Center also found that nationally, more than 50 percent of Black male students attending urban schools will drop out.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H9F6B53381CB94B9095ABB872803C44D5"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The low rate of high school retention among Black male students directly relates to high rates of joblessness and incarceration among this population. This barrier to employment exacerbates cycles of poverty, which in turn results in health inequalities, including higher levels of diabetes, obesity, and HIV/AIDS. According to a study by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, more than 66 percent of Black male dropouts are expected to serve time in State or Federal prison.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4A88BF28C7B14318845A26347C2465D4"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Black men are subjected to unequal profiling by the police and disproportionately harsh sentences in the judicial system. The Black male population is six times more likely to become incarcerated than their White counterparts. Although the Black male population comprises approximately six percent of the United States population, of the 2,300,000 people incarcerated nationwide, 1 million are Black males. Black males receive ten percent longer Federal sentences than White males who commit the same crime.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HAA38D6847A034A779CC251666CF1D06A"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to the Bureau of Statistics and the Pew Research Center, Black male unemployment is consistently almost double that of White male unemployment.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H6A3733FBDDFB46D8A0BC869D1FCBFE83"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Black fathers are more than twice as likely to live apart from their children as White fathers.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H49F3393982DC4F1CB144A9B416DC08BF"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Young boys with male mentors are more likely to progress further in school and have greater financial success in life.</text></paragraph></section> <section id="H8B37685C5C8546848DBED58D06202ED1"><enum>3.</enum><header>Commission establishment and membership</header> <subsection id="H3A95C697B0EB4A44B6651B47835773F2"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Establishment</header><text>The Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys (hereinafter in this Act referred to as <quote>the Commission</quote>) is hereby established within the United States Commission on Civil Rights Office of the Staff Director.</text></subsection>
