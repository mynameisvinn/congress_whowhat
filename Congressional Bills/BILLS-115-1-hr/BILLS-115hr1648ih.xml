On July 16, 2014, Ellie Helton, a vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, North Carolina, passed away as a result of a ruptured aneurysm, stunning her parents, two sisters, and many, many loved ones. A day earlier, on her second day of high school, she woke up with a terrible headache after a plum-sized aneurysm on her brain stem ruptured. While she suffered headaches throughout her life, she was never diagnosed. Ellie was an avid reader and excellent student, loved the arts, and was incredibly creative. She had an unwavering, constant love for the family and friends in her life.</text>

On March 20, 2015, Lisa Colagrossi—WABC Eyewitness News reporter, wife of 17 years, and mother of two sons—unexpectedly passed away at the age of 49 years after suffering a massive ruptured brain aneurysm. Despite experiencing one of the classic warning signs of a brain aneurysm (the <quote>worst headache of my life</quote>), Lisa’s passing came as a tremendous shock to her family and friends, who did not know what a brain aneurysm was, let alone its signs and symptoms. She is remembered for being a loving wife, a mother, and a successful reporter, and for her love of the New York Rangers.</text>

Jenny was a jogger, a disciplined exerciser, and a successful health care consultant and had recently launched a health blog founded on three principles—<quote>bee curious, bee radiant, bee well</quote>. Her brother, mother, father, and a large devoted network of friends and relatives remember her every day.</text>
