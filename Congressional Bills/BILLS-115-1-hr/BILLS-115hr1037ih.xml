With little regard for their own safety and in the face of all hazards the men and women of Emergency Medical Services respond across the spectrum of incidents from a single person’s medical emergency to the naturally occurring or man-made disasters, including terrorist attacks that threaten the entire Nation. This commitment to others, at a moment’s notice and despite risk, exemplifies the finest traditions of American spirit.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3A52B10CE21C48EEBDD9D92560C379DA"><enum>(2)</enum><text>As an element of the Nation’s homeland defense strategy, Emergency Medical Services stands on the <quote>Nation’s first line of defense in the prevention and mitigation of risk from terrorist attacks, man-made incidents, and natural disasters</quote>. The men and women of Emergency Medical Services, alongside those in Law Enforcement and the Fire Service, serving in both the public and private sectors as career and volunteer emergency medical service providers, are a critical element of the Nation’s homeland and national security efforts and provide for the domestic tranquility of its citizens.</text>

Statistics compiled by the United States Department of Labor and the National Highway Safety Administration indicate that emergency medical services providers die in the line of duty at a rate more than twice the national average for all occupational fatalities and during their careers experience an injury rate of virtually 100 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H74FD6B60DE0746CBBD5DE44DA69D3607"><enum>(4)</enum><text>We as a Nation have historically and continually rely on the selfless and ultimate sacrifices made by the men and women of this great country, their families, and loved ones in order to maintain the domestic tranquility, safety, and security of this Nation. The men and women of Emergency Medical Services continue to serve in this finest tradition, in the face of unacceptable sacrifice, risk and danger in service to the Nation and its citizens.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC7CB307D2C374357BF096FBF4F40CB25"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The scope of responsibility assumed by the men and women of the Emergency Medical Services is broad and unique and their sacrifice and commitment in service to our Nation are deserving of a commemorative work that recognizes such.</text>
