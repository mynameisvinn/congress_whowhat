<paragraph id="HCA49200017094566A3DF70A6CE62E693"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Pregnancy is a significant life event for millions of women in the United States each year.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9B2381B821A74A59AFC231EE56CA16D2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>For more than 30 years, our Nation, through the Medicaid program, has recognized that pregnant women need immediate access to affordable care, and has allowed women who meet income-eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid coverage when they become pregnant.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H73FA7397A2AA4000B50A20520C0A67A4"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Congress recognized the central importance of maternity coverage by classifying maternity and newborn care as one of the ten essential health benefits that must now be covered on most individual and small group health insurance plans under section 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/18022">42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1)</external-xref>).</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HF93782308F6B45E090AA71EE4D5A11DD"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has greatly increased access to affordable health insurance coverage for women. Today, more than 7,500,000 women have access to health insurance because of the law. That Act made it illegal to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, like pregnancy, or charge women more money for their premiums. That Act also required women’s preventive services like birth control to be covered without cost sharing.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H6029A283DEC74D5CB11A58362F503D00"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Access to comprehensive maternity coverage allows women to access important pregnancy-related care, which is demonstrated to improve health outcomes for women and newborns and reduce financial costs for both consumers and insurers.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H21B75D476343451CB0DE12F507602C27"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Uninsured women, women with grandfathered and transitional health plans, self-funded student health plans, and catastrophic and high-deductible health plans may lack access to comprehensive and affordable maternity coverage.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9458627EBDA34B22807337FA55F77418"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Employer health plans that exclude dependent daughters from maternity coverage leave young women without coverage for their pregnancy, even though Federal law has long held that treating pregnancy differently than other conditions is sex-based discrimination.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HBBD8537C8E59433A8DD994A3B2B44595"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A special enrollment period is especially important for young adults, who are at high risk for unintended pregnancies, yet young adults are frequently enrolled in catastrophic coverage, which often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, and higher deductibles.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H738B52A62B4041759C9FAD23FD40B717"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Timely maternity care improves the health of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and the health of babies throughout their lifetimes. Pregnancy-related maternal mortality is three to four times higher among women who receive no maternity care compared to women who do. Regular maternity care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related health complications, including preeclampsia, placental abruption, complications from diabetes, complications from heart disease, and Graves’ disease, all of which can result in morbidity or mortality for the mother or newborn.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE37823D0BF11482ABCAC58488F19AA65"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Regular maternity care can reduce preterm births and the health complications associated with preterm births.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H21351FCC60374974AC5DDC5439D4C751"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Timely maternity care can reduce short- and long-term health care costs. If a woman does not have access to affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, and she or her newborn experiences pregnancy complications that result in health problems after birth, their insurer may end up paying much higher costs than if the insurer had covered the woman’s maternity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity care can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care unit admissions among infants, resulting in cost savings of $1,768 to $5,560 per birth. For women with high-risk pregnancies, intensive maternity care saves $1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity care.</text></paragraph></subsection> <subsection id="H1E855B81B716415ABE5FA957E195176D"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>The purpose of this Act is to protect the health of women and newborns by ensuring that all women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges established under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>) and women eligible for other individual or group health plan coverage can access affordable health coverage during their pregnancy.</text></subsection></section>
