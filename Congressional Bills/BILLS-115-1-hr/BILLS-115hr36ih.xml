<paragraph id="H3D3787F935554D2789F77E8DF7B45943"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the unborn child’s entire body and nerves link these receptors to the brain’s thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks after fertilization.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H15B0DDC58F144FE7A5A1EA98A3586A1F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HD9C30B5FAF044B7C93C5D1DB02CD6E11"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress response.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC96706A6F3C8472387D135F7D2B09974"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HC816C5EAF7A844D380E75728E21C95C0"><enum>(5)</enum><text>For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia. In the United States, surgery of this type is being performed by 20 weeks after fertilization and earlier in specialized units affiliated with children’s hospitals.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H5A402E428ED242028C6DD05DF86B11DB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The position, asserted by some physicians, that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H12A7B281C51F40FBA1FB9A32A0E91674"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4CF0D8ACE8D9487F8EF42E6EFDA1841D"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H1EB42E687E564ECCAE0A55C44E5186F0"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HABBC760BB93D4146BA194643A596F339"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The position, asserted by some commentators, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vigorous movement in reaction to invasive surgery.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H8C43C2E99E0045E6A9C65B9C043C15AC"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H844C9FDB510641C49C206D3C405D6D22"><enum>(12)</enum><text>It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HF032601EC8F1490A81B9B56E722399C8"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither governmental interest is intended to replace the other.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HF3EF2B2F9B034348B02724576952BC0A"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Congress has authority to extend protection to pain-capable unborn children under the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause precedents and under the Constitution’s grants of powers to Congress under the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text></paragraph></section>
