 <paragraph id="H2A0EF696B70C43C5B82DF74AD29B6BA9"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programs offer tax preparation and related financial services, free of charge, to middle- and low-income individuals and families. The majority of individuals served by VITA programs have annual household earnings below $54,000.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF2A84F9A9D9540528311DC7E83D1C111"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">During the 2016 Federal income tax filing season, VITA programs filed more than 3.8 million Federal income tax returns. This included more than 714,000 returns for the earned income tax credit (EITC), helping program recipients claim $1.1 billion in EITC on their Federal tax refunds. One in five taxpayers who were eligible to claim the EITC failed to do so.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H64AA1C2543174C1491120F10AE4AD89A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>VITA programs assist underserved taxpayers, including low-wage workers, persons with disabilities, the elderly, Native Americans, rural populations, and taxpayers with limited English proficiency.</text>

Volunteer tax preparation programs serve as an accessible and cost-effective alternative to other Internal Revenue Service channels.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1086D3FE30074D74B9A86B99B681B127"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Internal Revenue Service estimates from fiscal year 2005 found that the volunteer preparation program cost $12.01 per contact, while Taxpayer Assistance Centers and assisted toll-free calls averaged $28.73 and $19.46 per contact, respectively.</text>
