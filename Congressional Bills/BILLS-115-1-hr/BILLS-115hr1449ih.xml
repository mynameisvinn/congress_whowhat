<paragraph id="H18948DB6C7C645F2B9473E33637FDA59"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, al-Qaeda leaders and the Afghan Taliban fled Afghanistan to Pakistan and settled in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Joint Task Force Guantanamo threat assessments subsequently revealed that Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) facilitated al-Qaeda’s movement of fighters to and from Afghanistan as well as the terrorist organization’s purchase of weapons.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE78956605B194E4592E102EAD64A570C"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Government of Pakistan, and the ISI in particular, provide support and a safe haven to groups designated as foreign terrorist organizations pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/8/1189">8 U.S.C. 1189</external-xref>) by the United States Government. Then Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen testified in 2011 that <quote>the Haqqani Network … acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency. With ISI support, Haqqani operatives planned and conducted</quote> various attacks against United States personnel and interests in Afghanistan, including a 2011 attack on the United States Embassy in Kabul.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDB7A5E213E4E4BAEAAF67176A803E36E"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The founder and leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was found and killed in the Pakistani military town of Abbottabad in 2011. The Government of Pakistan subsequently condemned the raid that killed the terrorist leader and continues to imprison Dr. Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who played an instrumental role in identifying Osama bin Laden’s hiding place.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1C7AB1CFA2A74AA98C64FD3C7B565E7C"><enum>(4)</enum><text>A 2012 NATO report indicated that the Afghan Taliban is directly assisted by the Pakistani security services and noted that <quote>Pakistan’s manipulation of the Taliban senior leadership continues [unabated]</quote>. The report also suggested that Pakistan is aware of the locations of senior Taliban leaders, including one who maintained a residence in the immediate vicinity of the ISI headquarters in Islamabad.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H7EB61B17B48D452EBF72898693427366"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, was located in southwestern Pakistan at the time of his death by a United States drone strike on May 21, 2016. Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province has long been a haven for the Afghan Taliban, and the group’s top leadership is headquartered in the city of Quetta in Baluchistan Province.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3A9E6D9DAA964EA5B8A5CEFCB0D89E5C"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Department of State’s 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism noted that Pakistan <quote>did not take substantial action against the Afghan Taliban or HQN (the Haqqani Network), or substantially limit their ability to threaten United States interests in Afghanistan</quote>. The report also stated that <quote>Pakistan has not taken sufficient action against other externally-focused groups such as Laskar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continued to cooperate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan</quote>. Moreover, since passage of Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘Buck’ McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/113/291">Public Law 113–291</external-xref>), the Secretary of Defense has been unable to certify that Pakistan has taken adequate action against the Haqqani Network in accordance with section 1222(f) of such Act.</text></paragraph>
