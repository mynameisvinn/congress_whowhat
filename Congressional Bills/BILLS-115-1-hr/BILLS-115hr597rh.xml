 <paragraph id="H0BA15D51053C402583CCB2632E7AF663"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Lytton Rancheria of California is a federally recognized Indian tribe that lost its homeland after it was unjustly and unlawfully terminated in 1958. The Tribe was restored to Federal recognition in 1991, but the conditions of its restoration have prevented it from regaining a homeland on its original lands.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H11FEBE72E1E04A00AD973CA41398F447"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Congress needs to take action to reverse historic injustices that befell the Tribe and have prevented it from regaining a viable homeland for its people.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5B28C058F1B748D88BBF57AE13FC729E"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Prior to European contact there were as many as 350,000 Indians living in what is now the State of California. By the turn of the 19th century, that number had been reduced to approximately 15,000 individuals, many of them homeless and living in scattered bands and communities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0C9E30F0C18D42B980AD12F97B180D8E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Lytton Rancheria’s original homeland was purchased by the United States in 1926 pursuant to congressional authority designed to remedy the unique tragedy that befell the Indians of California and provide them with reservations called Rancherias to be held in trust by the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H03A77E0E83914928B0849A9F3D0A35F8"><enum>(5)</enum><text>After the Lytton Rancheria lands were purchased by the United States, the Tribe settled on the land and sustained itself for several decades by farming and ranching.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7EB1B66D9F384CC49DEDD2B9BE85DCBA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy had shifted back towards a policy of terminating Indian tribes. In 1958, Congress enacted the Rancheria Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 619), which slated 41 Rancherias in California, including the Lytton Rancheria, for termination after certain conditions were met.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H411E649546984419BDC42B95E4D3FB3C"><enum>(7)</enum><text>On August 1, 1961, the Lytton Rancheria was terminated by the Federal Government. This termination was illegal because the conditions for termination under the Rancheria Act had never been met. After termination was implemented, the Tribe lost its lands and was left without any means of supporting itself.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD3D2610947554D30871D591D928F5C6A"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In 1987, the Tribe joined three other tribes in a lawsuit against the United States challenging the illegal termination of their Rancherias. A Stipulated Judgment in the case, Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Sugar Bowl Rancheria v. United States, No. C–86–3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22, 1991), restored the Lytton Rancheria to its status as a federally recognized Indian tribe.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEBC0A141FBDF44DAA9E8FF0E7F117AE9"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Stipulated Judgment agreed that the Lytton Rancheria would have the <quote>individual and collective status and rights</quote> which it had prior to its termination and expressly contemplated the acquisition of trust lands for the Lytton Rancheria.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9E036EFEDFDD4A2397B4FBC464A97EC7"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Stipulated Judgment contains provisions, included at the request of the local county governments and neighboring landowners, that prohibit the Lytton Rancheria from exercising its full Federal rights on its original homeland in the Alexander Valley.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H768A38A50A064ECC9E259563C7AD07F9"><enum>(11)</enum><text>In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land in San Pablo, California, was placed in trust status for the Lytton Rancheria for economic development purposes.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEB42F3EF24CD4D3781784BA7E31094E7"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The Tribe has since acquired, from willing sellers at fair market value, property in Sonoma County near the Tribe’s historic Rancheria. This property, which the Tribe holds in fee status, is suitable for a new homeland for the Tribe.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H13E9D6E9A9504DD8A82599CD41CE4381"><enum>(13)</enum><text>On a portion of the land to be taken into trust, which portion totals approximately 124.12 acres, the Tribe plans to build housing for its members and governmental and community facilities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA923B7C09EC34FF4A51B98E006887FE4"><enum>(14)</enum><text>A portion of the land to be taken into trust is being used for viniculture, and the Tribe intends to develop more of the lands to be taken into trust for viniculture. The Tribe’s investment in the ongoing viniculture operation has reinvigorated the vineyards, which are producing high-quality wines. The Tribe is operating its vineyards on a sustainable basis and is working toward certification of sustainability.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H54C92F6317254F229DA7B990E7B98EFA"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">No gaming shall be conducted on the lands to be taken into trust by this Act.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="HF2D435E9251B467BBD6482E7E46AB44B"><enum>(16)</enum><text>No gaming shall be conducted on any lands taken into trust on behalf of the Tribe in Sonoma County after the date of the enactment of this Act north of a line that runs in a cardinal east and west direction from the point where Highway Route 12 crosses Highway 101 as they are physically on the ground and used for transportation on January 1, 2016, and extending to the furthest extent of Sonoma County.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7867380E95B84A6680A3790FDBA16273"><enum>(17)</enum><text>Any agreement, now or in the future, regarding gaming restrictions between Sonoma County and the Tribe will be effective without further review by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFF65E0876E974FA4984AEBDF97F7E095"><enum>(18)</enum><text>By directing that these lands be taken into trust, the United States will ensure that the Lytton Rancheria will finally have a permanently protected homeland on which they can once again live communally and plan for future generations. This action is necessary to fully restore the Tribe to the status it had before it was wrongfully terminated in 1961.</text>
