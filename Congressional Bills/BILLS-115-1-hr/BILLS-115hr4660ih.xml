 <paragraph id="id23C99B76BD644E1FB79B28D393D4EF99"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Women are a vital part of American society and culture and possess the same fundamental human rights and civil rights as men.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id67CB3767BE934659A3D7346E358C3429"><enum>(2)</enum><text>United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits sex discrimination in various contexts, including the provision of employment, education, housing, health insurance coverage, and athletics.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idE73E901A906C4B01B4E4DFD6483F03BA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>A <quote>sex-selection abortion</quote> is an abortion undertaken for purposes of eliminating an unborn child of an undesired sex. Sex-selection abortion is described by scholars and civil rights advocates as an act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predicated on sex discrimination. By definition, sex-selection abortions do not implicate the health of the mother of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures motivated by sex or gender bias.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3693F3DA8CAB4E9EBB84F3B9DEED0014"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions performed in the United States and worldwide are overwhelmingly female.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id7B8B9AF123EC49D6908F911026781D6C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by United States law, and only 7 States ban abortions for reason of sex selection at some point in pregnancy. Sex is an immutable characteristic ascertainable at the earliest stages of human development through existing medical technology and procedures commonly in use, including maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, am­ni­o­cen­te­sis, chorionic villus sampling or <term>CVS</term>, and obstetric ultrasound.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id5B423E7A9BE2442FAFB0A59BAD818F72"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing the representation of women in the American population, and therefore, the American electorate.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idB2C94F2772F94ACAA122290279B4B9EB"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex discrimination and has no place in a civilized society.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="id638DF4D9A96747C4BCF89FE333CB1ED7"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The history of the United States includes many examples of sex discrimination. The people of the United States ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by enacting a constitutional amendment correcting an element of this discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have suffrage guaranteed by the 19th Amendment. The elimination of discriminatory practices has been and is among the highest priorities and greatest achievements of American history.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idE055D08A096845E39315D19F17AAE7E9"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Implicitly approving the discriminatory practices of sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will reinforce sex discrimination, and coarsen society to the value of females. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in acting—indeed it must act—to prohibit sex-selection abortion.</text>
