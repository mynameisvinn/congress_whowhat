 </paragraph><paragraph id="H937B8786244D44D9AE66767AD535F02F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Responsible community mortgage lenders provide a valuable and critical service to consumers by, among other things, fulfilling the housing finance needs of the communities they serve and providing locally based alternative sources for mortgage financing.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8AE73620C0104A60913A3FBD18BF5B4A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The activities and business practices of responsible community mortgage lenders do not pose a substantial risk to consumers, and did not pose a substantial risk to consumers when the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted.</text>

As a result of this oversight and control, the business practices and activities of responsible community mortgage lenders are safe, transparent to the public and the government, and do not pose a threat to consumers, the public at large, the United States financial markets, or the United States economy in general.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB66F02884A2143B881EA2C3B8C1AC230"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Responsible community mortgage lenders are unreasonably burdened by increasing regulation geared to problems that they did not create and activities that they did not and do not engage in, and therefore responsible community mortgage lenders are entitled to relief from certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its attendant regulations, including the regulations of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4FA7DFF17CC74FD0AD3AFEAC4B34D0FB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Without relief many responsible community mortgage lenders will be driven from the market thus limiting the consumer’s ability to choose a local lender for mortgage financing and dangerously consolidating the mortgage lending market into a smaller number of lenders.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4846708852594D0C8D69515C236DC7F2"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The preservation of responsible community mortgage lenders is critical to preserving competition and preventing increasing concentration in mortgage lending.</text>
