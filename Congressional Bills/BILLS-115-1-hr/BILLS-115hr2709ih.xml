 <paragraph id="HD606171BEDAB4C65BE8287A92CDF407A"><enum>(1)</enum><text>According to the National Academy of Sciences, STEM education at the undergraduate level is vital to developing a workforce that will allow the United States to remain the leader in the 21st century global economy.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H67FAC8C111AA4BB5A1654469E5F4FA95"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the 2013 American Community Survey Report on disparities in STEM employment, women comprise about half of the United States workforce but only make up 26 percent of STEM workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HADC05B9FB8F647B5A8E4A7A031B7877B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to the National Center of Education Statistics, women were more likely than men to switch out of STEM majors—32 percent vs. 26 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4AD8B2D161DB4E28B65FECE686143B6B"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to the 2010 Association of American University Women report <quote>Why So Few?</quote> approximately 52 percent of women in STEM fields quit their jobs about 10 years into their careers. It is important for gender equality to increase the retention of women in STEM fields, as women in STEM careers earn 33 percent more than those in non-STEM jobs, and have a smaller wage gap relative to men.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H570EE858F29546C2A48045ABF712D288"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to recent Census Bureau projections, minorities will account for 57 percent of the United States population by 2060. According to the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc., as the United States works to remain competitive in the world of technological innovation, the United States should address the need to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented minority segments of the population who work in engineering.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H48FD078B27684113B37286FF65E3E2D4"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8 percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields complete their degree within 5 years, compared to an approximate 33 percent and 42 percent 5-year completion rate for White and Asian students, respectively.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H86665223EA944331BAF5B6A917C2CFAA"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to the 2015 Asian Americans Advancing Justice report <quote>Making America Work</quote>, data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) on average hide the fact that some subgroups are underrepresented in STEM fields. For example: only 9 percent of Cambodian, 8 percent of Laotian, 8 percent of Hmong, and 7 percent of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander workers hold STEM jobs, compared to 12 percent of the total American population holding STEM jobs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HAE99E3FCF6664BF4879A5FB91BE67B5D"><enum>(8)</enum><text>According to 3-year estimates from the 2013 American Community Survey, Southeast Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment rates compared to the overall population. Fifteen percent of the overall population lives below the Federal poverty level, while 21 percent of Pacific Islanders, 21 percent of Cambodian, 26 percent of Hmong, 17 percent of Laotian, and 16 percent of Vietnamese community members live in poverty. Compared to 29 percent of the overall population with a bachelor’s degree or higher, members of Pacific Islanders, Cambodian, Hmong, Lao, and Vietnamese communities only have a bachelor’s degree or higher at rates of 15 percent, 16 percent, 16 percent, 13 percent, and 27 percent, respectively. Levels of poverty and postsecondary educational attainment correlate with these groups’ underrepresentation in STEM employment. Other Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups with similar poverty and educational attainment rates are similarly underrepresented in STEM employment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB1ED5E8C75F741DB8F237ABD036515E8"><enum>(9)</enum><text>A 2014 National Center for Education Statistics study found that women and underrepresented minorities leave the STEM fields at higher rates than their counterparts, leading to a need to develop resources to retain these groups in the STEM fields.</text>
