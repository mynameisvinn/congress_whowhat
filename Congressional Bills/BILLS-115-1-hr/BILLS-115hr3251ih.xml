The Northern Midwest route traverses Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and Colorado, and the Southern Midwest route traverses Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. After the two routes rejoin in Denver, Colorado, the route continues through Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. The trail is generally described in Volume 2 of the National Park Service feasibility study dated June 1995 which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Director of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, the District of Columbia. The American Discovery Trail shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with at least one competent trailwide volunteer-based organization and other affected Federal land managing agencies, and State and local governments, as appropriate. No lands or interests outside the exterior boundaries of federally administered areas may be acquired by the Federal Government solely for the American Discovery Trail. The provisions of sections 7(e), 7(f), and 7(g) shall not apply to the American Discovery Trail.</text></paragraph><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subsection> <subsection id="H4ABAF7569C91467998FD7A1CB33EA4A0"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Comprehensive national discovery trail plan</header><text>Section 7 of such Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/16/1246">16 U.S.C. 1246</external-xref>) is further amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:</text>

Where the designation of discovery trail is aligned with other units of the National Trails System, or State or local trails, the designation of a discovery trail shall not affect the protections or authorities provided for the other trail or trails, nor shall the designation of a discovery trail diminish the values and significance for which those trails were established. Not later than three complete fiscal years after the date of the enactment of any law designating a national discovery trail, the appropriate Secretary shall submit a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, development, and use of the trail, to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate.

Neither the designation of a national discovery trail nor any plan relating thereto shall affect or be considered in the granting or denial of a right of way or any conditions relating thereto.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subsection></section>
