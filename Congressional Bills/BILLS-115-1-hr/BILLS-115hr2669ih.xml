 <paragraph id="HC096D650054848F0B38E650BD8A45BA0"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">An inequity of voting rights exists in the United States because voters in some States have the universal right to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEEDB3FE4063E441A9DBC33BA24169C48"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Many voters often have work, family, or other commitments that make getting to polls and waiting in line on the date of an election difficult or impossible. Many citizens with disabilities are physically unable to vote due to long lines, inadequate parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabilities had difficulty voting, and more than 5,000,000 voters waited more than an hour to vote. Under current State laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE30E943C40184483A54FEAC7D1269D20"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Twenty-eight States currently allow universal absentee voting (also known as <quote>no-excuse</quote> absentee voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the request. No State which has implemented no-excuse absentee voting has repealed it.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4B3331A8FC0143B9B5738FF225AB85E7"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Three States currently hold elections entirely by mail. Twenty-two States currently allow some elections to be conducted by mail, especially in large and rural jurisdictions where voting by mail is especially convenient. Polling stations in rural jurisdictions tend to have higher costs per voter, smaller staffs, and limited resources. Transportation is often a crucial barrier for rural voters.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3F3BBA1BB4E64AF299A4FB45653906A3"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum process in many States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H60C57D29AFF147A59CF626C8FA58A651"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Voting by mail is cost effective. After the State of Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters in 1996, the cost to administer an election in the State dropped by nearly 30 percent over the next few elections, from $3.07 per voter to $2.21 per voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an average of 40 percent. The cost of conducting vote-by-mail elections is generally one-third to one-half less than conducting polling place elections. Voting by mail also saves a substantial amount by getting rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll workers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have been facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of poll workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1139E3E1B8DF4C8996EA7C5CCA311F51"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the polls. In 2016, voters in Arizona reported waiting in line from 1 to 5 hours to vote; in New York, voters reported that stations ran out of ballots and did not have staff during all of the hours scheduled for voting.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H64EB6B922CA04808996DFAC46EB1AA65"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an alternative to going to the polls. In 2012, 19 percent of ballots in the United States were cast by mail, up from 10 percent in 2000. Voting by mail has become increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote no matter what comes up on election day, as it reduces the physical obstacles and eases the time constraints connected with the act of voting.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HAE8003278A804034B8606BB79B7F250A"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The signature verification process, the tracking system for each ballot, and postal service cooperation in preventing ballots from being delivered to names not recognized as receiving mail at an address nearly eliminate the potential for fraud in vote by mail elections. Evidence of undue influence or voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementation in Oregon has been nonexistent to minimal.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB0796B388AEA4AB0843655FEB2C98B5C"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Many of the reasons which voters in many States are required to provide in order to vote by mail require the revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, or religious activities, which violate votersâ€™ privacy while doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H63C50CB2F3D84F52A374612FFCD1C01C"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">State laws which require voters to obtain a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to voters without increasing security.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H78BD944A9D8A4F399ACFB529EA6694E1"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Many voters choose to cast ballots early when they have the option (over 40 percent in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Tennessee). Nearly one-third of voters in the 2012 election cast their ballot before election day, which is about double the rate of voters in 2000. In Oregon, 7 years after vote-by-mail election implementation, over 80 percent of voters favored the vote-by-mail system.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="HF58F9B1060B348C1B55C5C8AFF01E2B8"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Vote-by-mail typically increases turnout in all elections, but can be particularly effective in increasing voter participation in special elections and primary elections. Oregon and Washington, the 2 States with the longest standing vote by mail systems, continue to have consistently high voter turnout rates. In the 2012 primary elections, while the national average turnout was 18 percent, Oregonâ€™s was 45 percent and Washingtonâ€™s was 38 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBB451AA8FC124C1798627680A4354ED3"><enum>(14)</enum><text>A crucial component of a modern voting system is making it easy, affordable, and accessible to register to vote. Eighteen States and the District of Columbia introduced automatic voter registration legislation in 2015, and Oregon and California now automatically register their citizens to vote when they apply for a driverâ€™s license. Automatic, permanent voter registration has the potential to increase participation, protect election integrity, and reduce registration costs.</text>
