(<quote>FCRA</quote>). The three largest CRAs in this country are Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. These CRAs are referred to as nationwide CRAs and the reports that they prepare are commonly referred to as credit reports. Furnishers, such as creditors, lenders, and debt collection agencies, voluntarily submit information to CRAs about their accounts such as the total amount for each loan or credit limit for each credit card and the consumer’s payment history on these products. Reports also include identifying information about a consumer, such as their birthdate, previous mailing addresses, and current and previous employers.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H28BE4AFBB9754932AE06B8B87423FE8D"><enum>(B)</enum><text>In a December 2012 paper, <quote>Key Dimensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Reporting System: A review for how the nation’s largest credit bureaus manage consumer data</quote>, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (<quote>Consumer Bureau</quote>) noted that the three nationwide CRAs maintain credit files on approximately 200 million adults and receive information from about 10,000 furnishers. On a monthly basis, these furnishers provide information on over 1.3 billion consumer credit accounts or other trade lines.</text>

Most creditors, for example, review these reports to make decisions about whether to extend credit to consumers and what terms and conditions to offer them. As such, information contained in these reports affects whether a person is able to get a private education loan to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, as well as the terms and conditions under which consumer credit products or services are offered to them.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H2454257001BC46899EF59ED0199420ED"><enum>(E)</enum><text>Credit reports are also increasingly used for many noncredit decisions, including by landlords to determine whether to rent an apartment to a prospective tenant and by employers to decide whether to hire potential job applicants or to offer a promotion to existing employees.</text>

Given the repeated failures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy requirements on their own, legislation is intended to provide them with detailed guidance improving the accuracy and completeness of information contained in consumer reports, including procedures, policies, and practices that these CRAs should already be following to ensure full compliance with their existing obligations.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H6067562FE20547B0A8FF9EC7ACDA8BAA"><enum>(H)</enum><text>The presence of inaccurate or incomplete information on these reports can result in substantial financial and emotional harm to consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to the loss of a new employment opportunity or a denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop someone from being able to access credit on favorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining rental housing, or even trigger mental distress.</text>

 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H6A4EB050D5494927A6F5DB1B6954F0E7"><enum>(P)</enum><text>According to the fall 2016 <quote>Supervisory Highlights</quote>, Consumer Bureau examiners determined that one or more debt collectors never investigated indirect disputes that lacked detail or were not accompanied by attachments with relevant information from the consumer. Examiners also found that notifications sent to consumers about disputes considered frivolous failed to identify for the consumers the type of material that they could provide in order for the debt collector to complete the investigation of the disputed item.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H505F5F279F3C4711A91D19FC26A9182C"><enum>(Q)</enum><text>A February 2014 Consumer Bureau report titled <quote>Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot</quote> found that consumers are confused about the extent to which the nationwide CRAs are required to provide them with validation and documentation of a debt that appears on their credit report.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="HBD062DD946E544948B9122A6E9B89781"><enum>(R)</enum><text>As evidence that the current system lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to develop more robust procedures to increase the accuracy and completeness of information on credit reports, litigation discovery documented by the National Consumer Law Center (<quote>NCLC</quote>), as part of a January 2009 report titled, <quote>Automated Injustice: How a Mechanized Dispute System Frustrates Consumers Seeking to Fix Errors in Their Credit Reports</quote>, showed that at least two of the three largest CRAs use quota systems to force employees to process disputes hastily and without the opportunity for conducting meaningful investigations. At least one nationwide CRA only allowed dispute resolution staff five minutes to handle a consumer’s call. Furthermore, these CRAs were found to have awarded bonuses for meeting quotas and punished those who didn’t meet production numbers with probation.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H3A7FD1094EC047BDB4297AFA36F61C6A"><enum>(S)</enum><text>Unlike most other business relationships, where consumers can register their satisfaction or unhappiness with a particular credit product or service simply by taking their business elsewhere, consumers have no say in whether their information is included in the CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or poor service.</text>

Given the lack of transparency about the usefulness of credit scores that are marketed for purchase by consumers from CRAs and the resulting consumer confusion, the Consumer Bureau recommended that companies selling scores to consumers clearly inform consumers that the scores marketed to consumers for purchase by CRAs can vary, sometimes substantially, from the scores that are actually sold to and used by creditors and lenders.</text>

You have a right to place a credit freeze on your consumer report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your consumer report without your express authorization. A credit freeze may be requested in writing by mail, by toll-free telephone, or by electronic means as provided by a consumer reporting agency. A credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a credit freeze may slow your applications for such accounts and you should plan ahead and lift a freeze in advance of actually applying for any of these type of accounts. When you place a credit freeze on your consumer report, you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to fully remove the freeze on your consumer report or temporarily authorize the release of your consumer report for a period of time after the freeze is in place to a specific party or parties. To provide that authorization you must contact each consumer reporting agency individually and provide your personal identification number or password, proper identification to verify your identity, and the period of time for which you would like the report to be available. A consumer reporting agency must authorize the release of your consumer report no later than 15 minutes after receiving the above information if the request is by toll-free telephone, or secure electronic means, and no later than one business day when a written request is submitted by mail. A credit freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account, that requests information in your consumer report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance. Unless you suspect you have been or are about to become a victim of identity theft, fraud, a related crime, or harmed by the unauthorized disclosure of your financial or personally identifiable information, are an active duty military servicemember, are 65 years of age or older, or as otherwise identified as an eligible consumer by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge you a fee of no more than $3 dollars each time you place, temporarily lift, or fully remove a credit freeze. However, if you reside in a State that provides greater protections with respect to the circumstances, method, or frequency for obtaining a credit freeze than is available under the Federal law, those State protections and benefits will apply to you.</text></section><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subparagraph><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block>
