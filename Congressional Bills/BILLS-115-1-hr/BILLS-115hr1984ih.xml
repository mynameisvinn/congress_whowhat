 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0A7D42491F6C4E5AA8068E19FBA2CA2E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Early detection for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB365724F2A964B1B9723F60FE4127829"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H663FDC5A3775401EB1CD8FBD832D4871"><enum>(6)</enum><text>It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.</text>
