Current sentencing enhancements do not reflect the danger fentanyl poses at lower quantities compared to other illicit substances.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD65162AC81394CFEA14BAC44B59AACCE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Because a lethal dose of fentanyl can be accidentally inhaled or absorbed through the skin, it’s not just deadly to its users, but it also threatens the lives of law enforcement and customs officials, public health workers, first responders and postal workers who risk unknowingly coming into contact with fentanyl in its different forms.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H71F81557D532477B9A175EABBB1B2287"><enum>(3)</enum><text>From 2013 to 2014, the number of drug seizures by law enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl increased by 426 percent and synthetic opioid-related deaths increased by 79 percent, with over 700 overdose deaths related to fentanyl. However, due to variations in States’ medical examiner and coroner testing and reporting techniques, and deaths attributed to heroin, this figure is believed to be significantly higher.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFE71320217DD456AB685BC98E7CA6CF7"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, pill press machines, and other supplies needed to manufacture counterfeit pills containing fentanyl are primarily sourced from China and widely available for purchase on the Internet. Traffickers can typically purchase a kilogram of fentanyl powder for as little as $2,000 from a Chinese supplier, transform it into hundreds of thousands of pills, and sell the counterfeit pills for millions of dollars in profit.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H85E4AE9768504937BD4CC3EB151911CB"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued nationwide alerts identifying fentanyl as a threat to public health and safety and stating that the rise of counterfeit pills that contain fentanyl in the illicit drug market will likely result in more opioid-dependent individuals, overdoses, and deaths.</text>
