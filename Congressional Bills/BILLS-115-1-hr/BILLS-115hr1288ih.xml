 <paragraph id="H727CD4A35E3145C690956F7A8E90E31F"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Numerous studies have highlighted the long-term academic benefits of high-quality early childhood education and care. The Learning Policy Institute, for example, reported in 2015 that North Carolina students who participated in early childhood programs received higher scores on third-grade standardized math assessments than their peers who did not participate. Similarly, Michigan children who attended early learning programs had better kindergarten readiness and better reading and math proficiency relative to their peers who did not have access to such programs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD7FB1BE2496F474CB26410435B1875BF"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Studies have also shown lower high-school dropout rates among children who participate in early childhood education programs relative to their peers who did not, showing that the positive results of quality early education programs continue for many years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF0E620BD462249F5ADC83CC3B6134D36"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Beyond academic benefits, researchers have shown positive economic impacts of early childhood programs. In 2015, a National Bureau of Economic Research study reported that each dollar invested in early childhood returns approximately seven dollars, in terms of workforce development. The Federal Reserve has also called for increased access to early childhood education, pointing to the potential for future economic development.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8E9676D7C0FB4DC2863B5420FCB31134"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">There has been a growing need for STEM workers that is projected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated in 2012 that STEM occupations will grow at a faster rate than other professions, noting also that the median annual salary for STEM workers is higher than for other professions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0ECE2F0C07B84EC09DDDEF2572A2BFEC"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Beginning STEM education as early as possible is key to future success in these fields, both in school and potentially in the workforce. To that end, businesses in the STEM fields like National Grid have sought through corporate citizenship programs to connect with and inspire young learners.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCB266FA61E214808B47487E2A923B584"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Studies have shown that simple, age-appropriate activities, like building a tower of blocks or spinning a mobile in a crib, can help encourage STEM learning. As a White House blog post on the importance of early STEM noted, <quote>Research indicates that as early as infancy, young children start developing and testing hypotheses for how the world around them works.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H733BF234D1BF4709A32D4F6AEAE9A027"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A 2014 study from the University of California-Berkeley Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that many early childhood practitioners feel poorly equipped to teach early STEM skills, making professional development and training opportunities critical.</text>
