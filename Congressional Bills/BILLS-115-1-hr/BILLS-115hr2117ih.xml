Any such rule shall become effective at the end of a 90-day period that begins on the date of adoption of the rule unless the corporation disapproves the rule before the end of the 90-day period (except that such 90-day period shall be tolled during any period in which a request by the corporation for additional information is pending). The corporation may disapprove a rule under this subsection only if it reasonably determines that the rule creates an unreasonable risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.</text></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block>
