In a fiscal year, any visa or nonimmigrant status reserved under this paragraph that is not used by the end of the third quarter of that fiscal year may be issued to an alien who is eligible for such visa or nonimmigrant status. In the case of an alien receiving a visa or nonimmigrant status under this paragraph, paragraph (3)(B) does not apply, unless for a fiscal year the number of petitions seeking visas or nonimmigrant status under this paragraph received during the first 10 business days that petitions may be filed exceeds 20 percent of all petitions subject to the numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(A).</text></paragraph><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block>
