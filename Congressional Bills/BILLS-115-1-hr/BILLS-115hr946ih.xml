<paragraph id="HB18B631D0202448DB5D566998988068E"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">29 States and the District of Columbia currently allow universal absentee voting (also known as <quote>no-excuse</quote> absentee voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the request, and no State which has implemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched back.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HFD078EB260DF4B71BCAC52F0F391B205"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum process in many States.</text></paragraph>
