 <paragraph id="H035CFBE4D7D649159664727A58BE3882"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Access to safe, legal abortion services is essential to women’s health and central to women’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDFAB2308DEEB452EACD5A2FE6074D74D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Access to safe, legal abortion services has been hindered in the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities and associated violence; restrictions on insurance coverage; restrictions on minors’ ability to obtain services; and unnecessary health regulations that single out abortion providers and those seeking their services, and which do not confer any health benefit or further the safety of abortion, but harm women by reducing the availability of services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC2E9041D30EC45F98B7592F95E1EAA23"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care facilities where abortions were performed, and associated violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, requiring Congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/103/259">Public Law 103–259</external-xref>) to address that situation and ensure that women could physically access abortion services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H550AB827036D4EF6826B4BD7C529BAB2"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Since 2010, there has been an equally dramatic increase in the number of laws and regulations singling out abortion that threaten women’s health and burden their access to safe abortion services by interfering with health care professionals’ ability to provide such services. The Supreme Court’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (579 U.S. ___ (2016)), reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion and struck down two unnecessary health regulations that created undue burdens upon access to abortion. Congressional action is necessary to put an end to these types of harmful restrictions. In addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the passage of laws that blatantly violate the constitutional protections afforded women, such as bans on abortion prior to viability.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2D0D7743C004464897BAA9FD41DC18BD"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States, safer than numerous procedures that take place outside of hospitals, as noted by the Supreme Court in Whole Woman’s Health. That safety is furthered by regulations that are based on medical science and are generally applicable to the medical profession or to medically comparable procedures.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H32D3B5797B9841448A0BFE6DD88F5A99"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Many State and local governments are imposing restrictions on the provision of abortion that are neither evidence-based nor generally applicable to the medical profession or to medically comparable procedures. Though described by their proponents as health and safety regulations, many of these abortion-specific restrictions do not confer any health benefit. Also, these restrictions interfere with women’s personal and private medical decisions, make access to abortion more difficult and costly, and even make it impossible for some women to obtain those services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB0AE88F626834B87BC9DF64ED3BA0FDA"><enum>(7)</enum><text>These restrictions harm women’s health by reducing access not only to abortion services but also to the other essential health care services offered by the providers targeted by the restrictions, including contraceptive services, which reduce unintended pregnancies and thus abortions, and screenings for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infections. These harms fall especially heavily on low-income women, women of color, immigrants, and women living in rural and other medically underserved areas.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7A09D0B54940411DB28EFFB3C5A76B11"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The cumulative effect of these numerous restrictions has been to make a woman’s ability to exercise her constitutional rights dependent on the State in which she lives. Federal legislation putting a stop to harmful restrictions throughout the United States is necessary to ensure that women in all States have meaningful access to safe abortion services, a constitutional right repeatedly affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, most recently in 2016.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H06B51C27BA3C4829A87039085D984DF9"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Congress has the authority to protect women’s ability to access abortion services pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
 </paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H1839918856BC4F5B8DE8F8EEA85DD5A6"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>It is the purpose of this Act to protect women’s health by ensuring that abortion services will continue to be available and that abortion providers are not singled out for medically unnecessary restrictions that burden women by preventing them from accessing safe abortion services. It is not the purpose of this Act to address all obstacles in the path of women who seek access to abortion (for example, this Act does not apply to clinic violence, restrictions on insurance or medical assistance coverage of abortion, or requirements for parental consent or notification before a minor may obtain an abortion) which Congress should address through separate legislation as appropriate.</text>
