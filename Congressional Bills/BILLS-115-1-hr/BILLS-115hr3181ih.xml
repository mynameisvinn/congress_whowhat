			 became unable to make health care decisions for yourself because of an
			 illness or injury? Do you hold certain values and beliefs with respect to
			 your medical treatment that you would want to be upheld if you were unable
			 to convey them yourself? That’s what an ‘advance directive’ is for. You
			 can use it to give directions for your health care providers and family
			 about your health care wishes that are to be followed if you are no longer
			 able to speak for yourself. You can also name someone you trust, like a
			 family member or friend, to give health care directions for you when you
			 can’t do so yourself.</list-item><list-item>You should consider carefully who to choose to speak for you and what directions you want to give
			 to ensure your representative clearly reflects your own values and
			 treatment preferences. You should not feel pressured to violate your own
			 values and preferences, and you are entitled to implement them without
			 discrimination based on age or degree of disability. </list-item><list-item>There are many resources to help you.</list-item><list-item>By choosing the name of a state at [INSERT name of webpage for the index provided in paragraph 4 of
			 this subsection and its URL (and, on the clearinghouse website, include a
			 hyperlink to it)], you can find sample advance directives for that state.
			 You can see any sample or required forms given in state law, as well as
			 others from individuals or groups with different viewpoints on advance
			 health care decisions which you may wish to review before completing your
			 own advance directive.</list-item><list-item>Below is contact information for the accredited vendor in your State who will arrange for your
			 advance directive to be confidentially kept online, where it can be seen
			 by doctors who are treating you so they are made aware of your wishes. You
			 can also give permission to certain other people, like family members or
			 friends, you want to be able to get a copy of your advance directive. If a
			 disagreement about your treatment develops, depending on your state’s law
			 certain other people may also be allowed to see it.</list-item><list-item>This vendor can also help you create an advance directive online or with paper documents, if you
			 wish. Online directives allow you to change or cancel one that no longer
			 fits with your wishes in a more timely manner.</list-item><list-item>[INSERT, name and contact information for currently accredited advance directive vendor (and, on
			 the clearinghouse website, hyperlinks to their website).]</list-item><list-item>Although any adult who is capable of doing so can use these resources to complete an advance
			 directive at any time, Medicare beneficiaries are particularly encouraged
			 to do so when enrolling in Medicare or during the annual enrollment period
			 when you can choose among different Medicare health insurance
			 alternatives.</list-item><list-item>In addition, some Medicare Advantage plans or supplemental insurance plans may offer a financial
			 incentive or other additional benefits for creating an advance directive
			 online.</list-item><list-item>By completing an advance directive you can not only make it more likely that your wishes about
			 health care will be known if you are unable to tell them at the time, but
			 also spare family, friends, and doctors the difficulty of trying to figure
			 out what you would have wanted. These are matters of the highest
			 importance that can affect life-or-death decisions, as well as your future
			 comfort and well-being. You are encouraged to think about them carefully,
			 and give serious consideration to recording your wishes in an advance
			 directive.</list-item></list>
