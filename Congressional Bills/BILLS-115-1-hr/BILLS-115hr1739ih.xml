 <paragraph id="H8A56F3571CFE4C63B0F1C078C1FC7574"><enum>(1)</enum><text>At present, 33 States and 2 United States territories have criminal statutes based on perceived exposure to HIV, rather than actual transmission of HIV to another. Eleven States have HIV-specific laws that make spitting or biting a felony, even though it is not possible to transmit HIV via saliva. Twenty-four States require persons who are aware that they have HIV to disclose their status to sexual partners. Fourteen of these 24 States also require disclosure to needle-sharing partners. Twenty-five States criminalize one or more behaviors that pose a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE700F22C9D1B4F85910FEF4DD9D6483B"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV is only transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD30AEEE9C9DD45378585D5428951E697"><enum>(3)</enum><text>HIV-specific criminal laws are classified as felonies in 28 States; in three States, a person’s exposure to another to HIV does not subject the person to criminal prosecution for that act alone, but may result in a sentence enhancement. Eighteen States impose sentences of up to 10 years; seven impose sentences between 11 and 20 years; and five impose sentences of greater than 20 years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97E3FC929BA84675AD69634D98C294E9"><enum>(4)</enum><text>When members of the Armed Forces acquire HIV, they are issued orders that require them to disclose under all circumstances including when the known risk of transmission is zero. Failure to disclose can result in prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H201760FA91A54DDDAC0658FDF477FCE0"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The number of prosecutions, arrests, and instances where HIV-specific criminal laws are used to induce plea agreements is unknown. Because State-level prosecution and arrest data are not readily available in any national legal database, the societal impact of these laws may be underestimated and most cases that go to trial are not reduced to written, published opinions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4C54A1A4B533430DBD6D4BB3A7E8649D"><enum>(6)</enum><text>State and Federal criminal law does not currently reflect the three decades of medical advances and discoveries made with regard to transmission and treatment of HIV/AIDS.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H64B6EE40B8384CB6A4A8560A12BE69E3"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to CDC, correct and consistent male or female condom use is very effective in preventing HIV transmission. However, most State HIV-specific laws and prosecutions do not treat the use of a condom during sexual intercourse as a mitigating factor or evidence that the defendant did not intend to transmit HIV.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6DB3E569B2204CA69F77D2EE0C90B4D0"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Criminal laws and prosecutions do not take into account the benefits of effective antiretroviral medications, which reduce the HIV virus to undetectable levels and further reduce the already low risk of transmitting the HIV to near zero.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0281F957F9734ACE9482C7BFDCB55478"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Although HIV/AIDS currently is viewed as a treatable, chronic, medical condition, people living with HIV/AIDS have been charged under aggravated assault, attempted murder, and even bioterrorism statutes because prosecutors, courts, and legislators continue to view and characterize the blood, semen, and saliva of people living with HIV as a <quote>deadly weapon</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE3551967859640E5889EEAC0820F9F0D"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that HIV-specific laws do not reduce risk-taking behavior or increase disclosure by people living with or at risk of HIV, and there is increasing evidence that these laws reduce the willingness to get tested. Furthermore, placing legal responsibility for preventing the transmission of HIV and other pathogens exclusively on people diagnosed with HIV, and without consideration of other pathogens that can be sexually transmitted, undermines the public health message that all people should practice behaviors that protect themselves and their partners from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF546F2FFF47842E09A24B8358704C460"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The identity of an individual accused of violating existing HIV-specific restrictions is broadcast through media reports, potentially destroying employment opportunities and relationships and violating the person’s right to privacy.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4BB7164DEDAA476EBB935F5363798F4B"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Individuals who are convicted for HIV exposure, nondisclosure, or transmission often must register as sex offenders even in cases of consensual sexual activity. Their employability is destroyed and their family relationships are fractured.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5FE90E6306754BF9BFFA5086B6CFD8D4"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The United Nations, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), urges governments to <quote>limit criminalization to cases of intentional transmission. Such requirement indicates a situation where a person knows his or her HIV-positive status, acts with the intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it</quote>. UNAIDS also recommends that criminal law should not be applied to cases where there is no significant risk of transmission.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3CF0FCAAF7A84736978BF2B2C2F89D13"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Global Commission on HIV and the Law was launched in June 2010 to examine laws and practices that criminalize people living with and vulnerable to HIV and to develop evidence-based recommendations for effective HIV responses. The Commission calls for <quote>governments, civil society and international bodies to repeal punitive laws and enact laws that facilitate and enable effective responses to HIV prevention, care and treatment services for all who need them</quote>. The Commission recommends against the enactment of <quote>laws that explicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure or non-disclosure of HIV status, which are counterproductive</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA891A3C5584543E898350617A89144D4"><enum>(15)</enum><text>In 2010, the President released a National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), which addressed HIV-specific criminal laws, stating: <quote>While we understand the intent behind these laws, they may not have the desired effect and they may make people less willing to disclose their status by making people feel at even greater risk of discrimination. In some cases, it may be appropriate for legislators to reconsider whether existing laws continue to further the public interest and public health. In many instances, the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.</quote>. The NHAS also states that State legislatures should consider reviewing HIV-specific criminal statutes to ensure that they are consistent with current knowledge of HIV transmission and support public health approaches to preventing and treating HIV.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H96F73241AEED46F2BFD6C28DB4804C91"><enum>(16)</enum><text>In February 2013, the President’s Advisory Council on AIDS (PACHA) passed a resolution stating <quote>all U.S. law should be consistent with current medical and scientific knowledge and accepted human rights-based approaches to disease control and prevention and avoid imposition of unwarranted punishment based on health and disability status</quote>.</text>
