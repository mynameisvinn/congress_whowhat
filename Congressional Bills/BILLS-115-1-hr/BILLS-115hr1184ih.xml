 <paragraph id="HF019E1EDBD8E4969B7BF5B3824CD3FF7"><enum>(1)</enum><text>It is the policy of the United States to ensure that all Americans are afforded just and reasonable communications services, including those families that pay rates for inmate telephone and video service.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H26610D4A40814B6AA9B80D562CFAE8BE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Telephone and video calls are the primary methods by which individuals correspond and maintain contact with family members who are incarcerated in correctional institutions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB5CD21D62C564686882FD7513F43E00C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Except for emergency purposes, family members are not allowed to call people incarcerated in correctional institutions, and incarcerated persons are typically allowed to call family members and other pre-approved individuals only through facilities physically located on the premises of correctional institutions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6353749D91BB4309924DF28AAD05E962"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Inmate telephone and video service in correctional institutions often is limited to collect calling.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD5BCDAED70324D589BB499356C58CF6D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Regardless of whether the inmates’ calls are placed collect or through a debit account, the inmates’ family members typically pay for the calls, either through their telephone bills, in the case of collect calls received from inmates, or by making deposits directly into inmates’ debit accounts.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H99593BA29D794875A9C7559B86556CCD"><enum>(6)</enum><text>It is clear from various studies that maintaining frequent and meaningful communications between people who are incarcerated and family members is key to the successful social reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals. Such contact reduces recidivism and facilitates rehabilitation, which in turn reduces crime and the future costs of imprisonment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB9CACF233DCA4BA9B037C5ABC4A0B3E0"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Frequent communication between incarcerated persons and family members is burdened, and in some cases, prevented, by excessive inmate telephone and video service rates. Excessive inmate telephone and video service rates thus weaken the family and community ties that are necessary for successful reentry into society by persons who were formerly incarcerated and the reduction in crime resulting from successful reentry.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3FC1160099D4440AAE6BDEF5561875A7"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Innocent citizens are paying excessive telephone and video service charges simply due to having a family member or loved one who is incarcerated.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCA9C8FACA16B481F8613F115FC540851"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The rates for calls from correctional institutions are some of the highest rates in the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H20489FE3D98A41DEAA5844AA9410B10C"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Information compiled by the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission shows that the high rates are due in part to the lack of competition between companies that provide long distance inmate telephone and video service to correctional institutions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H997F0C06B50B4F1983B52CB53A6B99CB"><enum>(11)</enum><text>There are no competitive forces providing incentives for those carriers to lower prices or operate efficiently because, unlike the mass market, only one carrier is typically permitted to provide long distance inmate telephone and video service within each correctional institution.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H60093C54F06448438675049B8852D910"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">High calling rates also are due in part to commissions that carriers pay to correctional institution administrators for the exclusive right to provide long distance inmate telephone and video service in a correctional facility. In some cases, such commissions can account for as much as 60 percent of the total revenues received from the use of prison payphones.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA500FA00514C479D85268F4C481526A4"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The collection of such commissions by correctional institution administrators and State departments of correction based upon interstate telecommunications revenues is a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC6F18E0A9DDB4DA9BD15FC926AF040EE"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Due to the lack of competition for telephone and video services within correctional institutions, families of people in prison, many of whom have low incomes, cannot choose the long distance carrier with the lowest calling rates and must pay the excessive rates charged by the carrier having the exclusive right to provide long distance service to the correctional institution from which the call originates.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H52AF944BB9B7403EBA650362DA308418"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The Commission has the expertise and authority to regulate inmate telephone and video service. Because parties to Commission rulemaking proceedings have raised issues regarding its authority to implement meaningful relief for excessive inmate telephone and video service rates, Congress finds it necessary and appropriate to reaffirm that the Commission has the authority to implement the types of relief set forth in this Act.</text>
