 </section><section id="H0EFCE5B93E8B4340964B2AD830BA886A"><enum>2.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds as follows:</text> <paragraph id="HD95DBA7C83D04C9E96F3112EFD618F81"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet for both children and adults, according to the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (referred to in this section as the <quote>Dietary Guidelines</quote>) published by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans are not meeting recommended intake for the dairy food group. Consumption of dairy foods provides numerous health benefits, including lowering the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H54CD15CE15C64D2ABFF32A645EBEC589"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy foods are excellent sources of critical nutrients for human health, including vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all of which are under consumed by people of the United States. When consumed in the amounts recommended by the Food Patterns of the Department of Agriculture, on average across the calorie levels, dairy foods contribute about 67 percent of calcium, 64 percent of vitamin D, and 17 percent of magnesium.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2AC7212D5E37483CA84B713858CCD585"><enum>(3)</enum><text>About 30 percent of adolescent boys meet or exceed the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day, but less than 10 percent of adolescent females meet or exceed this recommendation. An age-related decline in dairy intake appears to begin in adolescence and intakes persist at very low levels among adult females across the age distribution. Less than 5 percent of adult females consume the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day. Overall, more than 80 percent of the entire population of the United States does not meet the daily dairy intake recommendation.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFC7FF3B084664D30A35FF550F5A5396B"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Dietary Guidelines state that vitamin D and potassium amounts vary across plant-based milk alternatives. The amount of calcium per calorie is lower for most plant-based alternative milk products. To obtain the amount of calcium contained in one cup of non-fat fluid milk from a plant-based milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake must be greater.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HAF4530046CC64F859E468491F8B1FFF4"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Imitation dairy products, such as plant-based products derived from rice, nuts, soybeans, hemp, coconut, algae, and other foods that imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not provide the same nutrition content as real milk, cheese, and yogurt derived from dairy cows.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDFC17A4F97144630A1BB4AE42A0CAF87"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading to consumers.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="H4C91F8045F8346DBB9D482B01044CB67"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Food and Drug Administration has regulations that define milk and cream as the <quote>lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows</quote> (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations). This definition further applies to milk used to create other dairy products, including yogurt and cheese, as specified in sections 131 and 133 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
