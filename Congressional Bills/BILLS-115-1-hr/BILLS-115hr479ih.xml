 <paragraph id="HAF847ABBDAE544C2B6A9343EF220F0D6"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Government of North Korea was designated a state sponsor of terrorism on January 20, 1988, for repeatedly providing support of acts of international terrorism.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H74D2C529287A401C866FC44B2F692A56"><enum>(2)</enum><text>However, on October 11, 2008, North Korea’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism was rescinded, following commitments by the Government of North Korea to completely, verifiably, and irreversibly dismantle its nuclear weapons program, yet North Korea has failed to live up to these commitments and is continuing to produce ever greater quantities of fissile material for nuclear weapons and periodically conduct testing of nuclear explosive devices.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H50D11F31AE714F69B9D203784661A967"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Consequences of a state sponsors of terrorism designation include a ban on arms-related exports and sales; restrictions on exports of dual-use items; restrictions on foreign assistance; financial sanctions against transactions with the designated government; imposition of miscellaneous trade and other restrictions; and potential liability in United States courts for acts that fall within the terrorism exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The criminal code also prohibits financial transactions by United States persons with any government designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Issuers of securities must disclose in their public filings any investments in states whose governments sponsor terrorism. Finally, a designation requires United States representatives to oppose any benefits or extensions of credit to any designated government by international financial institutions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H478FC8609DA1452280F4D7101F0ECE3B"><enum>(4)</enum><text>On October 22, 2015, Ambassador Sung Kim, Special Representative for North Korea Policy with the U.S. Department of State, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade that North Korea’s <quote>conduct poses a growing threat to the United States, our friends in the region, and the global nonproliferation regime</quote> and Ms. Hilary Batjer Johnson, Deputy Coordinator for Homeland Security, Screening, and Designations with the U.S. Department of State noted that <quote>weapons transfers that violate nonproliferation or missile control regimes could be a relevant factor for consideration, depending on the circumstances, consistent with the statutory criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H64AD8D39ED774C00885685E821314D00"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Government of North Korea has harbored members of the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking and continues to harbor the surviving hijackers to this day.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC642A152200E486A83D22DF690014330"><enum>(6)</enum><text>On July 16, 2010, in the case of Calderon-Cardona v. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (case number 08–01367), the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico found that the Government of North Korea provided material support to the Japanese Red Army, designated as a foreign terrorist organization between 1997 and 2001, in furtherance of a 1972 terrorist attack at Lod Airport, Israel that killed 26 people, including 17 Americans.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD9F387E04C24484DADF1DD78DAECF76C"><enum>(7)</enum><text>On April 18, 2013, Michael Flynn, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified that Syria’s liquid-propellant missile program depends on essential foreign equipment and assistance, primarily from North Korean entities. Further statements by United States Government officials report that North Korea helped Syria build the Al Kibar nuclear reactor, which Israel reportedly destroyed in 2007, and could have been used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE89580266F5943119696F53E4A8A7DF9"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Of the three foreign governments currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism, the governments of Iran and Syria are designated as state sponsors of terrorism for their support of Hamas and Hezbollah. The Department of State’s 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2013 <quote>Country Reports</quote> all cited Iran and Syria for supplying weapons to Hezbollah through Syrian territory, and most of them also cited Iran’s training of Hezbollah.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCF8968DEB1454163A5E1F9F26C8A0CA8"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah (case number 09–646), a United States district court found in 2014 that North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization, against Israel in 2006.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8AA7C8303FD94A05A2B9BBA63B761633"><enum>(10)</enum><text>In December 2009, a North Korean arms shipment aboard an Ilyushin Il–76 cargo plane was discovered and seized by authorities of the Government of Thailand. The cargo, which was marked as consisting of oil-drilling equipment, contained 35 tons of rockets, surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS), explosives, rocket-propelled grenades, and other weaponry. A similar shipment was impounded in the United Arab Emirates a few months earlier in July 2009. A third shipment was intercepted by the Israeli government in the Eastern Mediterranean in November 2009. According to published media reports, United States and Israeli intelligence agencies concluded that the shipments were destined for Iranian-backed terrorists, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Quds Force. Another large quantity of shipments to both Hamas and Hezbollah, is believed to have been transferred unnoticed.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA74DC8856CCD4433912F6B8238A29020"><enum>(14)</enum><text>On December 16, 2015, the <quote>Guardians of Peace</quote> sent a message to Sony Pictures, to <quote>clearly show it to you at the very time and places <quote>The Interview</quote> be shown . . . how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to</quote>.

 </paragraph></subsection><subsection id="HA1E4FE41F85A4E3AB13DE58B19792BBE"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Sense of congress</header><text>It is the sense of the Congress that the Government of North Korea likely meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and, if so, should be so designated. North Korea has failed to live up to its 2008 commitments to verifiably dismantle its nuclear weapons program and appears to have continued to support acts of international terrorism after its removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in October 2008.</text>
