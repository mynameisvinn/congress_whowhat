Chronically homeless people often live in shelters or on the streets for years at a time, experience repeated episodes of homelessness without achieving housing stability, or cycle between homelessness, jails, mental health facilities, and hospitals.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H8B186CBC882A4E8CB1809229CC29B395"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2003, the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommended the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan designed to facilitate access to 150,000 units of permanent supportive housing for consumers and families who are chronically homeless. The Commission found that affordable housing alone is insufficient for many people with severe mental illness, and that flexible, mobile, individualized support services are also necessary to support and sustain consumers in their housing.</text> </paragraph>

Since the USICH’s implementation of <quote>Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness</quote>, chronic homelessness in the United States has been reduced by 22 percent, including a 13 percent reduction in unsheltered chronic homelessness.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H5E430AD9E1A643B2B266BD87C0031623"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Research indicates that permanent supportive housing is a cost-effective solution to chronic homelessness that leads to improved residential stability and reduction in psychiatric symptoms.
