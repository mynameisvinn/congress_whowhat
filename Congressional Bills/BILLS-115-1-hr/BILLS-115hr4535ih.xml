It is also used commercially in herbicides and poultry feed.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBAB0CC125C6F4887B9870B9C291E76DD"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to the European Food Safety Authority, the estimated exposure of young children to inorganic arsenic is 2 to 3 times the exposure of adults to inorganic arsenic.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDDB1B091E39844F2B90D734D858B48F7"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to the European Food Safety Authority, diet is the main source of arsenic exposure for most individuals.</text>

According to the Food and Drug Administration, inorganic arsenic has been detected in an infant’s first foods, such as infant rice cereal and brown rice syrup used in an increasing number of products including toddler formula and snack bars. Inorganic arsenic is also found in other rice products including children’s breakfast cereals and rice itself. Rice may continue to be a large part of the diet of children who have swallowing difficulties and gastrointestinal reflux, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</text>

The Food and Drug Administration has established a limit of 10 parts per billion in bottled water, and has also proposed a limit of 10 parts per billion in apple juice. However, there are no Federal limits for arsenic in most foods, including rice for adults and children or baby foods.</text>
