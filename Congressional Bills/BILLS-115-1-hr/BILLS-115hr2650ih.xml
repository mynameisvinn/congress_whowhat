 <paragraph id="H018D8825FE7448FFA06C9D12C20C11AB"><enum>(1)</enum><text>In enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (adding section 703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), Congress reaffirmed its understanding that unlawful discrimination is often difficult to detect and prove because discriminators do not usually admit their discrimination and often try to conceal their true motives. Section 703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly approved so-called <quote>mixed motive</quote> claims, providing that an unlawful employment practice is established when a protected characteristic was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6076D15470614B49A624969300A5D40A"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Congress enacted amendments to other civil rights statutes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (referred to in this section as the <term>ADEA</term>), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but Congress did not expressly amend those statutes to address mixed motive discrimination.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H358C0FFFA0EA45CAB520E3B1354D7DE6"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the case of Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Supreme Court held that, because Congress did not expressly amend the ADEA to address mixed motive claims, such claims were unavailable under the ADEA, and instead the complainant bears the burden of proving that a protected characteristic or protected activity was the <quote>but for</quote> cause of an unlawful employment practice. This decision has significantly narrowed the scope of protections afforded by the statutes that were not expressly amended in 1991 to address mixed motive claims.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H168B3EDFC64D4121BCC2E893DFEFC154"><enum>(2)</enum><text>to reject the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the Gross decision that Congress’ failure to amend any statute other than title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (with respect to discrimination claims), in enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, suggests that Congress intended to disallow mixed motive claims under other statutes; and</text>
