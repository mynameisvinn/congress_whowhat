 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB95BB720906D490193C42A7290DD9E29"><enum>(2)</enum><text>During a 40-year career with the National Park Service, Mr. Bearss distinguished himself as one of America’s preeminent historians, particularly in the field of the Civil War, not only through his work to preserve the places in which our nation’s history was forged but also through his captivating interpretive storytelling about the people and events that shaped those places.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H96D9005C0BE54931BE8963158248E15C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Mr. Bearss’ lifelong love affair with the Civil War was kindled during his youth when he read a biography of Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart. Even at an early age, Mr. Bearss demonstrated a knack for committing facts to memory, a skill that helped him win school contests in history, current events, and geography.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4C1499FE42F04F80B26C78B05FB27A99"><enum>(4)</enum><text>He graduated high school in May 1941 and the following year joined the U.S. Marine Corps, serving with the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion during the invasion of Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands. He was badly wounded in gunfire at <quote>Suicide Creek</quote>, Cape Gloucester, New Britain, while serving with the 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEF998F202FEA4BB182820D969AA78A80"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Upon returning home, Mr. Bearss attended Georgetown University, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Foreign Service studies, and later attended Indiana University, earning a master’s degree in history.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2109EB8BDEB5410F9DCA415F8C3A0BBA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>It was during a fortuitous visit to the Shiloh National Military Park in Tennessee, on a tour with the park historian, where the seeds were planted for Mr. Bearss’ future career with the National Park Service.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0F2A9568BA8A4C18A85896E61BDF145B"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In 1955, he landed a job as park historian at the National Battlefield Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where his research helped fill in missing pieces of Civil War history. None were more significant than the discovery of the USS Cairo, a long-lost Union ironclad gunboat sunk by Confederate submarine torpedoes in 1862 that was buried in the mud of the Yazoo River. Mr. Bearss later authored a book on the <quote>sinking and salvage</quote> of the ironclad.</text>

He once said, <quote>You can’t describe a battlefield unless you walk it.</quote>. Anyone who has spent time with Mr. Bearss touring a battlefield, sometimes braving the elements, enthralled by his prodigious tales regards him as a National Treasure. His unique chronicling of our nation’s history has been described as a <quote>transcendental experience</quote> of <quote>Homeric monologues</quote> punctuated by <quote>colorful, vivid images</quote>. Mr. Bearss himself has been described as a cross between <quote>a good-natured platoon sergeant and Walter Cronkite</quote>.
