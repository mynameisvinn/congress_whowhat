<paragraph id="H202C4DC26249442CACF5CFB552E0CC67"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Pollination services are a vital part of agricultural production, valued at over $125,000,000,000 globally. According to a 2014 Presidential memorandum, pollinators provide for an annual amount of $24,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States and honeybees account for $15,000,000,000 of such amount. Similarly, pollination services of native pollinators, such as bumblebees, squash bees, and mason bees, contribute over $3,000,000,000 to the United States agricultural economy and are estimated to contribute between $937,000,000 and $2,400,000,000 to the economy of California alone.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA11FDD31F5184CD2991C306D491F079D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>One-third of food produced in North America—including nearly 100 varieties of fruits and vegetables such as almonds, avocados, cranberries, and apples—depends on pollination by bees.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H1922DCB6F85E4965A1EB2CE1C2675ADB"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Over the past several years, documented incidents of colony collapse disorder and other forms of excess bee mortality have been at a record high, with some beekeepers repeatedly losing 100 percent of their operations. The national honey crop reported in 2013 was the lowest in many decades.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7DC3BFD0D69643A08C9000BAE0A757BF"><enum>(4)</enum><text>A recent national survey sponsored by the Federal Government indicates that United States beekeepers experienced a 45.2 percent annual mortality rate with their hives during the period beginning in April 2012 and ending in March 2013. During the winter of 2013–2014, two-thirds of beekeepers experienced loss rates greater than the established acceptable winter mortality rate.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H37D1C6A984F94EEEB6507E2A342B17EB"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to scientists at the Department of Agriculture, current losses of honeybee colonies are too high to confidently ensure the United States will be able to meet the pollination demands for agricultural crops.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H410E256F78154150AC1500781C7B24B6"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Native pollinators, such as bumblebees, have also suffered alarming population declines. There are currently more than 40 pollinator species federally listed as threatened or endangered, and most recently, the iconic monarch butterfly has declined by 90 percent.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HF7D387F2E49C497F83D6713E6456A971"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Scientists have linked the use of a certain class of systemic insecticides, known as neonicotinoids, to the rapid decline of pollinators and to the deterioration of pollinator health.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H45D817B6A8D445C68B0B19A8F789F819"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Neonicotinoids cause sublethal effects, including impaired foraging and feeding behavior, disorientation, weakened immunity, delayed larval development, and increased susceptibility to viruses, diseases, and parasites. Numerous reports also document acute, lethal effects from the application of neonicotinoids.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAE4C408F0E404B1DAC02ED0E05603471"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Conclusions from a recent global review of the impacts of systemic pesticides, primarily neonicotinoids, warn that they are causing significant damage to a wide range of beneficial invertebrate species, are a key factor in the decline of bees, and pose a global threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Another recent global review documented high levels of freshwater contamination.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4B0196691757487E8DAF9AD3CD7EFE5C"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Science has demonstrated that a single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid is toxic enough to kill a songbird. Peer-reviewed research from the Netherlands has shown that the most severe bird population declines occurred in those areas where neonicotinoid pollution was highest. Starlings, tree sparrows, and swallows were among the most affected.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H88272C3CC6AC4503A15A64D49DD773C5"><enum>(11)</enum><text>In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority determined that the most widely used neonicotinoids pose unacceptable hazards to bees, prompting the European Union to suspend their use on agricultural crops.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA38E52F41B094942AA1839E67885D2CE"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees were killed as a direct result of exposure to a neonicotinoid applied to linden trees for cosmetic purposes.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H7D04E9B9DF904C888AD7938577C6315D"><enum>(13)</enum><text>In February 2014, Eugene, Oregon, voted to ban the use of neonicotinoid pesticides on city property. Similar bans and restrictions have been enacted in Thurston County, Spokane, and Seattle, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H057B7ACEB656431DB448ECEA7943B32D"><enum>(14)</enum><text>In June 2014, a Presidential memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force after identifying pollinator decline as a threat to the sustainability of food production systems, the agricultural economy, and the health of the environment in the United States.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFD3D7EC1AECA43BB8D0B2D87C4251324"><enum>(15)</enum><text>In July 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to phase out neonicotinoid pesticides in all national wildlife refuges across the United States by January 2016. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognized that the prophylactic use of neonicotinoids for agricultural purposes harms a wide range of nontarget species and is therefore inconsistent with the management policy of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4722B9DD75694C83BE2CBECFB7BBCAF6"><enum>(16)</enum><text>In October 2014, an assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency found that neonicotinoid seed coatings provide little benefit to overall soybean crop yield. Additional studies determined that in approximately 80 to 90 percent of row crop uses, neonicotinoid coatings are unnecessary. The prophylactic overuse of neonicotinoids violates the fundamental principles of integrated pest management.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HEEDB896EEED04AB4A708AEE0862AAA3F"><enum>(17)</enum><text>In November 2014, the Province of Ontario, Canada, announced the province will move to restrict the use of neonicotinoid-coated corn and soybean seeds because of the broad harms from their overuse, with a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2017.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE3203525AF0F4CAFB5989A7C826FA242"><enum>(18)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In September 2015, the Circuit Court of the United States for the Ninth Circuit ruled to revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval for sufloxaflor—a neonicotinoid pesticide.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H59B62CC23B9B4B9CA9A69DBB23686DE8"><enum>(19)</enum><text>In November 2016, Health Canada, the Department of the Government of Canada with responsibility for national public health, proposed a ban on almost all uses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, saying it is seeping into Canadian waterways at levels that can harm insects and the ecosystem.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8CE5F1C01C7A4DCBA69D0DA67DF13073"><enum>(20)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The President’s budget for fiscal year 2018 cuts funding for pesticide review programs of the Environmental Protection Agency by 20 percent delaying reviews of new, potentially safer pesticides as well as reviews of older, more dangerous pesticides such as neonicotinoids.</text></paragraph></section>
