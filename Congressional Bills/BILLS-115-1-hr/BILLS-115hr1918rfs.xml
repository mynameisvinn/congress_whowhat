 <paragraph id="H73530F6E3E434F76BE80E2F97A2990F5"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The House Committee on Foreign Affairs convened a congressional hearing on December 1, 2011, entitled <quote>Democracy Held Hostage in Nicaragua: Part 1</quote> where former United States Ambassador to Nicaragua Robert Callahan testified, <quote>First, that Daniel Ortega’s candidacy was illegal, illegitimate, and unconstitutional; second, that the period leading to the elections and the elections themselves were marred by serious fraud; third, that Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista party have systematically undermined the country’s fragile governmental institutions.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC2248A52A8244A3BA39A73AF06618C29"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">According to the Organization of American States (OAS) report on the Nicaraguan 2011 Presidential elections, the OAS recommended that the Government of Nicaragua take a number of steps to improve its electoral systems, including accrediting poll watchers to ensure political parties and civil society are represented to observe elections, and redesigning the structure of the Nicaraguan electoral council to allow proper registration of the electorate.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC97A685BB33744E7888C04FF0FA335DB"><enum>(3)</enum><text>On January 25, 2012, a press statement from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: <quote>As noted by international observers and Nicaraguan civil society groups, Nicaragua’s recent elections were not conducted in a transparent and impartial manner, and the entire electoral process was marred by significant irregularities. The elections marked a setback to democracy in Nicaragua and undermined the ability of Nicaraguans to hold their government accountable.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD4A5DB7D4E524C60B653CA26F115C2BA"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s 2015 Fiscal Transparency Report: <quote>Nicaragua’s fiscal transparency would be improved by including all off-budget revenue and expenditure in the budget, auditing state-owned enterprises, and conducting a full audit of the government’s annual financial statements and making audit reports publicly available within a reasonable period of time.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H61DCB4D7ACDC46648C4D4A5F5CB6B09C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015: <quote>In 2011 the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) announced the re-election of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in elections that international and domestic observers characterized as seriously flawed. International and domestic organizations raised concerns regarding the constitutional legitimacy of Ortega’s re-election. The 2011 elections also provided the ruling party with a supermajority in the National Assembly, allowing for changes in the constitution, including extending the reach of executive branch power and the elimination of restrictions on re-election for executive branch officials and mayors. Observers noted serious flaws during the 2012 municipal elections and March 2014 regional elections.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4F940C9A7BEA44CEAF9E0926E77C32BD"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 in Nicaragua: <quote>The principal human rights abuses were restrictions on citizens’ right to vote; obstacles to freedom of speech and press, including government intimidation and harassment of journalists and independent media, as well as increased restriction of access to public information, including national statistics from public offices; and increased government harassment and intimidation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4224EF12AE3849149BBA1548D4D6BC12"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The same 2015 report stated: <quote>Additional significant human rights abuses included considerably biased policies to promote single-party dominance; arbitrary police arrest and detention of suspects, including abuse during detention; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions with arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detention; discrimination against ethnic minorities and indigenous persons and communities.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H089F335E35FE452291787A3FCE88ED55"><enum>(8)</enum><text>On June 7, 2016, the Department of State’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor posted on social media: <quote>Disappointed government of Nicaragua said it will deny electoral observers requested by Nicaraguan citizens, church, and private sector * * * We continue to encourage the government of Nicaragua to allow electoral observers as requested by Nicaraguans.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97E035822AD449B6B59FE840E60FD276"><enum>(9)</enum><text>On June 14, 2016, President Ortega expelled three United States Government officials (two officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and one professor from the National Defense University) from Nicaragua.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBE188B24D5194E2E9707AA6C4939250B"><enum>(10)</enum><text>On August 1, 2016, the Department of State issued a press release to express grave concern over the Nicaraguan government limiting democratic space leading up to the elections in November and stated that <quote>[o]n June 8, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court stripped the opposition Independent Liberal Party (PLI) from its long recognized leader. The Supreme Court took similar action on June 17 when it invalidated the leadership of the Citizen Action Party, the only remaining opposition party with the legal standing to present a presidential candidate. Most recently, on July 29, the Supreme Electoral Council removed 28 PLI national assembly members (16 seated and 12 alternates) from their popularly-elected positions.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE75C105E204E40A7B4EA491534BC39E5"><enum>(11)</enum><text>On November 7, 2016, the Department of State issued a press release stating: <quote>The United States is deeply concerned by the flawed presidential and legislative electoral process in Nicaragua, which precluded the possibility of a free and fair election on November 6. In advance of the elections, the Nicaraguan government sidelined opposition candidates for president, limited domestic observation at the polls and access to voting credentials, and took other actions to deny democratic space in the process. The decision by the Nicaraguan government not to invite independent international electoral observers further degraded the legitimacy of the election.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H07EB655ACDA24252A6F99529D09AC706"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In November and December of 2016, the Board of Executive Directors of the Inter-American Development Bank postponed consideration of a policy based loan of $65 million to the Government of Nicaragua due to the efforts of the United States mission that expressed serious concerns of the absence of transparency, systemic corruption, and the lack of free and fair elections in Nicaragua.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H367FD0685ED14DD78E5330F98FE8260F"><enum>(13)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: <quote>[A]ctions by the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party resulted in de facto concentration of power in a single party, with an authoritarian executive branch exercising significant control over the legislative, judicial, and electoral functions.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDC54C01782C14AE8BE330A04F7A7820D"><enum>(14)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 in Nicaragua, <quote>The November 6 elections for president, vice president, national assembly members, and representatives for the Central American parliament did not meet the conditions of being free and fair * * * The November 6 presidential and legislative elections were marred by allegations of institutional fraud and the absence of independent opposition political parties. National observers and opposition leaders claimed rates of abstention from 60 to 70 percent.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1D2497D6FE334E22B8334414152B55DB"><enum>(15)</enum><text>According to the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: <quote>Companies reported that bribery of public officials, unlawful seizures, and arbitrary assessments by customs and tax authorities were common * * * The courts remained particularly susceptible to bribes, manipulation, and other forms of corruption, especially by the FSLN, giving the sense that the FSLN heavily influenced CSJ and lower-level court actions.</quote>.</text>
